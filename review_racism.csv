90,"Please, never go to this restaurant. The food ranges mediocre to downright bland, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so overpriced. I'm sorry, but $20 for a flatbread that's half the size of a pizza? Is it supposed to be an entrée, or a joke? $25 for a plate of spaghetti? Even if the pasta is handmade (and I don't think it is) that's crazy. The wine list is pretty ok, but this isn't the only place in Pittsburgh to drink wine, and I can guarantee you that anywhere else you choose would have better food. 

I'd probably be more forgiving of the lack-luster menu if it weren't for other factors. Because the real downfall at Pino's is the owner, Joe. This man has no tact, no grace--and judging by the food, absolutely no talent in the kitchen. I've been to Pino's a handful of times, as it's near my home, and honestly, I really wanted to like it. But each time I've been in, I'm surprised by the extent of this man's unprofessionalism. He has a very large presence and is very outgoing, but not in the way you want. You'll notice from other reviews that he does not take kindly to criticism. If you don't like something you ordered, keep your mouth shut or be prepared for a debate over the quality of the product. I've even witnessed him making racist comments about his diners--for example, I overheard him one evening saying he was glad that two ""asian"" customers had come in that night, ""because they're good tippers."" I don't know how they didn't hear him, because the dining room isn't that big, and this guy doesn't know how to keep his voice down. 

That was pretty much the last straw for me. The amount of pride Joe and his staff seem to have in their restaurant is completely disproportionate to the quality of food, and certainly their customer service. Take my advice, don't waste your time here."
2142,"How to put this gently?

While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day, I will never return to the Carnegie Museum of Art. 

It's not that I mind that its gallery seemed small compared to others I have viewed (sometimes small museums have some hidden treasures) or that one whole gallery was blown glass and I felt like I was at a bong shop on haight st. in sf. 

It comes down to the fact that a docent, while trying to explain a painting with a watchtower in it, told the students it was a watchtower ""from Auschwitz, a place where they basically fried a lot of Jews"".  Seriously? That's how she chose to describe concentration camps to a large class of what I could only guess were middle schoolers? It sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint...""oh that place? they basically just fry eggs"".

On top of all that, the description of the piece stated the watchtower was reminiscent of those that were spread throughout East and West Germany during Hitler's rule (i.e. not those in Auschwitz).

In sum, docents are a reflection of the institution in which they volunteer, and this one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, if you're going to hire racist people to lead your tours, at least make sure they have their facts straight (or can read)."
4050,"Let's call this place for what it is: it's a racist establishment.

3~4 bartenders going around the bar and exiting as if they were on a carnival ride.

Taking care of everyone else and not once asked what I wanted

Hailed one of them for a drink. Didn't even offer a food menu.

After three sips I asked for a food menu. 

Bartender nearly tosses it across the table.

Paid for the lousy $6 beer and got up. The whole time the patron next to me was eyeing the whole situation as if expecting a bigger reaction from me.

Asked for the manager and brought it to his attention. His response: ""oh, I had no idea, I apologize"""
6864,"I would write a ""0"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the ""Unblurred"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No ""reserved"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. 

Whether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? 

With the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."
11710,"A museum dedicated to post-Civil War Charlotte. 
This downtown museum takes you through the history of Charlotte, explaining why all the roads are so confusing, why Charlotte is such a financial city, and how the Civil Rights movement transformed Charlotte as a city. 
Charlotte's history isn't all roses and BBQ. There were some dark days in Charlotte's past. The KKK, poverty and racism kept a large segment of the state down. But FDR came and visited Charlotte, and the city became a boom town, for cotton and culture. Later, banks moved in, and has turned this city into one of the largest financial cities in the country! 
The exhibits are well done and interesting. My favorite part was how they leave out Post-It notes for visitors to comment on what they've just seen. Some of the comments were rather critical, on how the museum got certain things wrong, or were still showing some racist ignorance in their displays. For instance, they had a bit on how blacks couldn't vote just after the Civil War, and someone put a note up pointing out that women couldn't vote at that time either. 
The gift shop was nice, but a bit on the random side. I guess there was some stuff having to do with Charlotte, but they didn't seem to have anything too cool, other than North Carolina wines. 
Near the entrance is an information kiosk, where you can pick up all the latest brochures, magazines, literature- anything you need to know what's going on in and around Charlotte. 
Parking was easy - the museum validated parking at the garage next door."
13072,"The bar itself is good and the servers do a great job but man do the patrons suck! I went once and some guy decided to ""make it rain"" and started flipping out because dudes were picking up the money. If you're dumb enough to throw a pile of money in to the air you better bet your ass that us broke college kids are going to pick it up! It's also predominantly African American (or at least it was when I went) which is totally fine but some of them looked like gang members. I'm sure I'll get called racist for that but it's the honest truth. I also saw a lot of people getting upset over the dumbest stuff...like getting their shoes stepped on, while standing in the middle of the dance floor! I will say they had a great deal on drinks when I went! $1 for anything!"
15164,"Granted I haven't been in since my ""experience"" I really don't have a desire to go back.

The night my friend and I decided to give it a whirl.. well, we drove up and the parking lot was full of Cadillacs and Buicks. Should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked. 
There was a very large, foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door. Hmmm.. We walked up and he looked at us like, what are these two white girls doing here? We were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them), swung around to look at us. It was, seriously, just like the old Westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes. 
We stood there, for a hot second, a guy started hitting on my friend so I pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of there.
I could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left.

Hmm.. maybe we were there on the wrong night.



**For the record, because I'm sure someone will get offended... I am in no way racist and I would have LOVED to stay and party with everyone. The only reason we left was because we felt entirely, completely unwelcome."
15845,"I like this YMCA , it's the only y in Charlotte that has a jacuzzi , the set up is super cool. But my issue is . It's a bit racist if your black they think your sneaking in trying to steal stuff . I had a woman tell me I look like a thief I can't come in this way to go to the locker room. If you do not come in there dress like a business savvy person , the red button goes up. Second mainly the woman that's been coming for a long time walk around butt naked , it's so disgusting they get in the jacuzzi necked and shave there private areas in front of ppl. It's just to much . My husband says the men do it to. And they would have a towel around there neck while they are talking to you. The staff doesn't do anything about it , cause they say they been here for a long time and they do not want to upset them."
18984,"Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star.
 This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads, there was black all over the a/c vents and the shelves in the closet were literally falling off the wall and the carpet had huge nasty stains everywhere. We were told our place was clean and ready to move in. 
I have a medical condition called Cystic Fibrosis, I am on a lot of medication and my meds get delivered by UPS or FedEx to the front office. After the third box of my meds arrived, in about a weeks time, the leasing staff labeled me as being contagious and treated me like dirt. 
After being there for two months, my doctor at MUSC in Charleston told me I have to live close to the hospital in order to get proper treatment and be able to go into the hospital when I am sick. We gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter. The manager said, oh that's fine don't worry about it feel better (in her fake voice). Now, two years later I see they have put me on collection for $2000. 
No way will they get away with this. Do not rent from these Losers! How do they sleep at night"
19731,"I did not set out to write a bad review.  I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING

Positive:

Food:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.

Service:  Initially good

Negative:

Price: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.

Coupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.

Atmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. 

Bathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort

Waitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.

Extra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.

Kids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.

Air conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.

Note to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.

Note to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers."
27350,Went to az for a business trip. Got so hungry and this restaurant filled me up with happiness. The best experience I had in az. Don't like the racist people in Phoenix though.
29115,"I've been waiting to go here - mostly because Cheuvront is my senator and I wanted to believe that he could do more than make racist comments at equality rallies (seriously - was anyone else there for that...wtf). 

But I was really impressed by their wine and their cheese selection. It's the best wine bar I've been to in Central Phoenix. I had an amazing bottle of Malbec and their memolet was fantastic. 

We sat at the bar and the man waiting on us was really helpful and attentive. It was fairly quiet in here but it was a weeknight. Not sure what the weekends look like.

My only complaint/inquiry/confusion was - no door handles going to the bathroom? how do I know which side to push on? weird and not high-art enough to be cool."
32566,"Worst Experience Ever!
Not only did my BLT come with hard dried up bacon and hardly any Mayo to help the lingering dry sensation taking over my mouth; I was also subjected to the most racist beings ever.
Sitting with my date I overheard a woman looking to be an owner of the establishment belittling her cooks and staff because they were ""Speaking Spanish and ruining the experience.""
I could not hear the cooks, nor should this be a problem when speaking to one another.
The racism was horrendous, and this was not the only comment I was subjected too while attempting to enjoy my meal. (In the summer heat with no A/C on. The Ice Cream could not even stand the temperature.)
Also a warning to all, if you are amid the LGBT+ community this is NOT the place for you. According to the same woman, complaining about her cooks speaking to one another, all beings who hold love for the same sex must have mental disorders, and unfortunately this too is a quote."
38565,"I live and own my property for 11 years and the HOA will not do anything about the animal problem that has been happening for the past two years.  This cat keeps coming to sleep, release its feces, attacking birds and eating them on my property.  The HOA property manager Judy O'Claire tried to put blame on the Glendale Code Compliance as well as vice versa.  Nobody wants to take responsibility and now I have to confront the neighbors at 6402 W Lawrence Lane, hopefully I don't get shot at.  I don't understand why this management company does not take responsibility and continues to not enforce the CC&Rs.  For nine years they kept sending me warnings about my garbage containers being exposed on my yard and a few weed warnings which was not true, and now I have to deal with somebody else's wandering pet because the darn property manager thinks it's my problem.  Those neighbors need to stop feeding all the cats from this and other neighborhoods and start taking responsibility or jail, including Osselaer Company who will land in jail too.  Judy O""Claire is a racist and discriminates against disabled homeowners, she will deceive that she does not know who I am when I have confronted her over two dozen times during the 11 years I've lived there.  Beware if you are having problems with the property managers, go to the president of the company."
42149,"WORST PLACE EVER, the mc at karaoke night its the most racist ever, you need to change her, otherwise your place will be worth nothing. The owner on the other hand, wont listen to the clients suggestions, and take part with the shitty employers. We order  drinks and the asked us to leave the place, they wouldnt even let us finish our drinks. So, its a really racist place that I do not recommend. Dont go there, period."

46241,"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. That is exactly where I am at with the beloved Swizzle Inn. But only with a certain semi-tall blonde (brunette w/highlights) bartender who apparently refuses to acknowledge me hanging over the bar with empty drink in hand as she prepares drinks for everybody else that walks up after me. Not on one occasion...three. Now, since I'm one to give the benefit of the doubt I can afford to give her some leeway. Here it is: 1) She is inept at her job who folds at the first sign of decent business and is unable to differentiate who was waiting first. 2) She would rather I be a six foot blonde chic who has the hots for her. 3) She is a racist that would prefer to snub me albeit I have a history of tipping well. 4) Number one and three. 5) Number two and three. 6) All of the above. 7) She can't handle the pressure of working at a small neighbor bar solo. 

Whatever the answer is, it's ashame because I'm all for the neighborhood bar. 

My last attempt was to purchase a $50 gift certificate for a friend who loves the place. I'm actually glad this chic saved me $50 by acting like a flustered nincompoop. 

Alright, I'm done. This place is too cool to totally abandon but I'm not giving this particular ""woman""any more of my money.

Thanks for reading."
48006,"I'm only giving this place two stars because the customer service was great.

Overall the hotel itself is a little outdated.  The TV, phone and clock are up to date but everything else was not.  It's a very clean room, nothing majorly wrong with it.

The downside is that the walls are paper thin.  We were just having a conversation and security knocks on the door telling us to lower the volume.  Lower the volume on what? So if you are a person with a ""loud"" voice, don't even bother staying here because the next night around 8pm, we get a call.  I didn't even bother answering because I figured it was the asshole racist security guard.  They have pre conceived notions that African Americans can't afford places like this buuuut your the one whose a rent-a-cop! I guess he had to feel big about himself since he might lack in other areas.

I've stayed at the Ritz in downtown LA and that place was top notch, 5 stars compared to this place.  Just because your in the Biltmore area, does not mean you have class. I doubt I'll come back here because I like to have conversations and not remain silent if I'm not under arrest Mr. Rent-A-Cop!"
49473,"This restaurant is for the rich kids that had never eaten any other fine food in the world other than steaks : ) Pricy steak (cow that is not even organically raised). Salmon that is farm raise(Atlantic). The steak that is almost tasteless. Veggies that are plain but buttery. The server was kind of racist (only asked what my white friend wants to drink, didn't ask me, and then brings me water). The only good thing about this place is the interior itself. The dinner alone was 83 dollars(split amount 3 people). If you have friends that want to get you there please steer them away because both of your stomach and wallet will leave unsatisfied."
63135,The Indian lady that owns this franchise here is extremely racist and didn't let me use 2 type of breads for 1 sandwich even tho I was willing to pay more ughh hopefully subway sees this and stops her rain #sandwich#nazi
65084,"This is a little, local owned store that pales in comparison to other local owned stores.  Having had reptiles, fish and birds my whole life, I would never buy anything from the wild, and this place has a reputation for having cheap prices because of the low quality of their animals.  I have found wild caught animals in this store repeatedly.  I have also seen animals very improperly housed, along with feces in the cages.
I have also had a conversation with the owner who was dropping some very racist bombs into the conversation about our current president and anyone who speaks multiple languages.  
It seems that all of the knowledge they have is only gained from elementary readings and minimal experience.  Their fish selection looks as though it was an old Walmart setup, which means if one fish is sick, they are all sick.
It is hard to tell people not to support a family owned business, but with a racist husband and a lady that never moves from her stool behind the counter but has an attitude on her, and with experiences as described above, it gets somewhat easier to tell you to go to another store.  It is worth it to drive to another pet store that does not support taking animals from the wild, does not hire weirdo's, and has a less ""racist"" staff.  I know of another reptile store at Bell and Cavecreek that has a much, much better selection."
70143,"They are very, very, VERY racist!! This is my 3rd time visiting this yummy Mexican place. The food is AMAZING! Sadly they are racist :( The first time I ate food from here my husband got it to go(my husband is white...blonde hair, green eyes), while I waited in the car. He ordered me nachos and got him self carne asada fries. The nachos were really yummy, but they didn't have a lot of toppings. I went back on my own about a week and a half ago and the food they gave me was AMAZING! It was 100 times better than what my husband got! I'm middle eastern, but can pass as Mexican. I assumed my food was better because there was a man working the register and cooking the food. I decided to go back a few days ago for lunch because the food was sooooooo good! Well, this time there were women behind the counter....they were super nice and friendly! I noticed some white people come in and her attitude completely changed, she was rude and almost seemed annoyed that they were there. Their food was ready before mine, the quality was the EXACT quality my husband got! My food was ready right after theirs, and mine was AMAZING wayyyy better than what they got!! 

I don't think they like white people....the whole menu is in Spanish! I can read and speak Spanish...so it's no problem for me. I think if they really wanted Americans in their restaurant.... they would translate the menu. I give it 3 stars because they are nice to me and the food is AWESOME! I take away the other two because they were not so nice to my husband :("
71548,"Wow this was place is so creepy and the customers are just as creepy,A friend of mine hade mentioned that this place had good breakfast,so I thought I would give it a try.I walked in the joint to give it a try and the looks i got when i walked in where enough to make me want to run out I have never seen more racist freaks crammed into a small place in my life,The Career sever was just as racist as all of the freaks in the joint, just rude as hell,Bottom line if you you want to experience phoenix racism at it's best go to 40th st Cafe,food cold service terrible and rude career waitress from hell, i would warn anyone who is not white and ignorant to not set foot in this place,more freakks and employees crammed into this place than i have ever seen!Stay clear unless your writeing a book on racism in phoenix at its best."
72928,The security guard at night called me a racist name. I was a long term guest at this place waiting for my house to finish and the management there seemed racist and judgmental towards young pretty single females. I would never recommend anyone to rent from here because of the current manager in charge and the racist security guard that totally disrespected me. I spent a lot of money to stay here and I was disgusted by the treatment I received in return.
73730,"I would like you to know this was a HORRIBLE experience & me and my family will NOT be returning.So we were in a lay over coming from Cancun then to SFO everything was fine until after we picked up our luggage to recheck it in.We noticed the two families from our flight going into the same area but before that we have to show our card with our family members name on it well the two families before us were able to go ahead but this man told us we have to go to the side to have a man re look through all our bags which made NO sense because we literally just picked them up and the families ahead of us were able to go so I brushed it off as if whatever but in the back of my head wondered why this man let those families go through with no problem?So we got to the last station were we believe the workers name was Perea?but we heard another man call him Alvin by the first name,talk about RUDE! He asked if we had food I said one piece of a hamburger left maybe like 2 inches and he yells ""IS IT PORK?!""and I proceeded to say ,""no I believe it is meat,you can take it if you'd like"" and he yells back at me, ""UH NO THIS IS NOT TRASH CAN"" & let me inform you this is in front of my family my mother,little sister,& grandmother so we just look at each other like OK?so he informs us to put our suitcases on the machine to have them go trough so we start out with my 70 year old grandmother who's bag weighs about 26 pounds this man yells at her!Saying""DON'T THROW IT ON THERE""now tell me how is my 70 year old grandmother going to throw a 26 pound bag?!so we proceeded to put ours and once again yells at us to not throw it,I'm not sure if this man needs a nap or a raise but he was scum and deff needs to be talked to. So that experience sucked so finally got our baggage re checked for our next flight now to head to the security/TSA department now let me say something really quick I am NOT racist I am Hispanic & most of my friends are Caucasian but how I was treated in the TSA department was HORRID! We got our Passports checked and were told to go through the security as is everyone else, well we were on one side,there was a group of Indian decent men in front of us,a Caucasian family behind us & in the booth next to us only Caucasian people.So we put our stuff through the machine next to a TSA machine & also a metal detector.I'd like to know  how come the Caucasian woman working sent the Caucasian group of people next to us all through the regular metal detector but had my whole family and the Indian men in front of us go through the TSA machine but as soon as I'm waiting for my turn in the TSA this woman let the cacusian people behind me just go through the metal detector!!!!!! I'd like to say that's some bullshit especially because all I was wearing was a tank top shorts and flip flops NO JEWELRY! What could it had hurt if I went through the regular detector!!!!This makes no sense to me and as soon as I walk out the TSA machine ANOTHER woman working there stops me and rechecks me with a hand metal detector!!!! are you shitting me?! My family just standing there looking at me like are you serious?! So this makes no sense to me and is just pushing me to make even a bigger uproar.So when she was done I proceeded to get my belongings and walk out but the flapping door wouldn't push open so I had to pull it towards me to get out and the woman YELLS,""NO it's the other way PUSH IT!""seriously if it worked the other way I would have I'm not an idiot it says PUSH but it wasn't exactly even on the sides so it wouldn't. Finally we had gotten out that area and proceeded to our Terminal where all the seats were taken up and 6 were taken up by a Caucasian man who felt the need to sleep across all the chairs we tried to wake him to move but nope nothing so we proceeded to tell the  woman working can you please have him move but did she do anything??oh OF COURSE NOT so we were left to sit on the ground!! Thank you! I have to say we were so disappointing we heard Arizona was disliked for some of their racial issues and also are being attacked by LULZSEC and the hacking of Arizona police but DAMN REALLY?No wonder it's so hott it is HELL.
p.s. They say they have free WIFI but it didn't work on my Iphone or Laptop.



and for a update they called me to apologize & said it had nothing to do with my race,that maybe I WAS HAVING AN OFF DAY?!wow....I appreciate them actually calling back but the least they could of offered me a Starbucks gift card comeeeeeeeeeeeeee on."
82432,"i mever write any reviews but i felt the needs to do this in order to warn others. DONT USE BRISTOL WEST!!!!!!!!!!!! i filed a claim but they switched my adjustor without notifying me first, then she gave my case back to the first guy wo telling me again. no one responded to my calls or had any info i provided about 5times. when adjustor finally called, he made an extremely racist comment against my ethnicity and when i called him out, he raised his voice and responded with bad bad attitude, icouldnt be more shocked!!!!! his name is brian cargile fyi. dont use this company, they are rude, unprofessional, and apprently has 'no way to make any complaints'."
83258,"When you first walk in you may think this is just another strip mall soggy egg roll, is that meat? Chinese restaurant. You would be wrong! This place has amazing service (thank you Stacy) and when I say amazing I mean service that would rival Capital Grill if it were a small establishment, that part may all just be Stacy :-) but the food is definitely Mr Cho and it's refreshing to have a chef with the last name Cho and not Rodriguez. No offense of course but traditional has its own special feel and taste and smell and it's wonderful to get it from someone truly rooted in the fairs homeland. (I'm part Mexican so don't call me racist I had tacos for breakfast!) I don't want me Cho cooking my enchiladas either. 

Ruling: Good food, good service and damn I'm good lookin!"
83521,"My wife and I were unsure as to what to expect after the few reviews we read that rated this place so terribly... We were very pleasantly surprised! 

The restaurant was clean and the servers were nice. Our hot tea was as authentic as it gets (my wife's green tea was indeed green and earthy as it should be) The food all looked good and there was a fantastic variety. Not being racist or anything but I was glad to see that there wasn't a ""Mexican"" dish in sight, as so many other Chinese buffets in Arizona do. 

Honestly I've never been a Chinese buffet fan because I'm a picky eater, usually I just end up eating the American food and possibly egg drop soup. I was glad that I ended up trying a few things I usually wouldn't eat. The sesame chicken was great and whoever that guy at the stir-fry station was rocks! Next time I'll be sure to bring cash to tip that guy for the tasty food he put out for us!!! Oh and the dessert! Holy crap the dessert... We laughed as they mislabeled the red velvet cake as cheesecake but it was delicious! And the chocolate mousse cake was exactly what my wife needed after a stressful day.

All in all this was one of the most enjoyable and worthwhile Chinese buffets I've been to in a VERY long time and we will most definitely be going back!

Oh and to those who rated this place poorly... Where the hell do you eat at? Did you eat Chinese food here? Are you maybe mistaking this place for somewhere else? If this place was so terrible, I dare you to try it again after going somewhere like Lin's... See how you feel after that!"
91751,"This one star is specifically for IRENE the cashier. She was INCREDIBLY RUDE and profiling. I would also say probably racist bc she was nice to the people in front of us. If you have a problem with a PAYING CUSTOMER you should NOT be in retail! 

First incident: she placed the video game I bought for my brother in the bag directly without taking off the security cover. I notified her of doing this, and she said what do you want me to do about it? I want you to remove it so I won't exit the store with a problem! It's like she had never done it in her life. She had to insert my DOB so I handed her my license bc she asked me for it. She then threw it across the counter at me instead of handing it to me directly. 

Second incident: I had a coupon for coffee, and she threw it at me saying is this yours? Yes, it is mine. And I wanted you to scan it so I can use it, idiot. 

Third incident: I inserted my card and she yelled at me saying to not remove it. I know. I can read, and this isn't my first time purchasing anything with the new chip. Plus, it CLEARLY says in English ""please do not remove your card."" 

Fourth incident: she tried offering me a job as if I'm not employed. Yes, I may look like I've had a rough week but that's because I work 12.5 hour shifts at the hospital. She also said this was her second job so I can have another. Hahahahahahahahaha! Classic. I guess I look like someone who can't afford my lifestyle and need a second job! Sorry, woman. I thought of that before I graduated college. 

Irene is the greatest target employee ever. Insert sarcasm here. I wish to never come across her customer service. Ever again. And I go to target weekly."
95040,"I like to go into gun shops and look around.  Since everyone started to convince themselves the ""gubmint"" was coming to get their guns it has been an even more interesting experience (I own plenty of guns...but there are some people who have no business having one and a trip to your local gun store will give you exposure to plenty of them).  

So over the years I think probably purchased 2 or 3 guns from this store (in whatever stage of ownership it may have been in), but yesterday's trip was one for the record books.

So the store was relatively empty (about 4 customers or so) and about two guys behind the counter.  One of the guys behind the counter was running his mouth pretty heavily and quite frankly set the world land speed record for racist comments.  Now I'm no shrinking flower here but to hear someone pop off so many comments in such a short period (may 2 minutes tops) was nothing short of racist artistry.  In short his topics were...

- Brown people (he never got to a point on this one, but last I checked about 35% of AZ is populated by ""brown people.""  I guess he has a problem with them)

- Blacks all have free cell phones (where do these morons get this one?  The program  for phone service for the ""poor"" (wide definition here and includes Medicare recipients...and the list goes on) was started under Reagan, expanded under Clinton and cell phone inclusion was under Bush II)

- Sand people (this one had something to do with the Boston bombing.  On the other hand, who knows...we live in the desert so maybe he was pissed at AZ ""sand people"")

- Welfare has increased by 70% for some of the aforementioned groups under Obama (this one is just too stupid to comment on)

There were a few others thrown in, but by this point in his observations on life I was just amazed that he wasn't dressed in a hood and sheet and kind of quit listening.

All in all an interesting trip, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last."
109348,"My girlfriend and I went to check this place out, mind you I'm asian and she is half-irish/half-jamacian. We were given the coldest look when we came in. Ordered a large square pan, was given a 35 minute wait, and a hour later no pizza because we found out another group who ordered the same thing was given the pizza we ordered. BULLSHIT, that is some racist ass stuff. So he instead gave us a medium sized pan and refunded us the difference. In the end pizza was bland and cheaply made. Waste of time and money. Will NEVER come back!

RATING: GARBAGE!"
112376,"My husband and I are regulars at K O's and have dinner and play trivia every Wednesday night.  We were there on October 21 to watch the baseball playoffs.  We are always pleased with the service and quality of food items.  The wait staff are friendly and efficient.  I would venture to say that the unfavorable reviews recently posted were written as a result of a group going way too far in trying to harass guests with their political, biased, and racist comments over a loud speaker system.  The staff should be congratulated on how they handled a difficult situation.  We frequent K O's for a fun social evening with friends and feel comfortable knowing we can feel safe and free from harassment."
118134,"My son had a $50 gift certificate to John Henry's Restaurant; (supposedly a fine-dining establishment) and on a moment's notice asked his mother (me) to go out for dinner. (I usually YELP restaurants before I go out  to eat somewhere but due to the last minute plans I did not have a chance to do so.) And I am thinking - $50 couldn't go too wrong.
Enter the TWILIGHT Zone.....................

Ok.   so you have  an English sounding restaurant  but with an Italian Menu, Croatian  Greeter/Manager, a decor that is Southwestern with weird French accents; and such inept waiters who are unbelievable.

  Let's start with OUR WAITER.  The manager promptly seats us.
10 minutes later, our server appears- very friendly- but immediately announces he hasn't worked in months since working here years ago and we (unfortunately ) are his very first patrons sinc returing to work here!) .   He proceeds to tell us of his  past misfortunes and  subsequent travels around the world.  Meanwhile, we are thirsty and would like (at least some water) and perhaps order a drink.  When he is finished, I asked  what the house wine was - Response - ""Gee, I don't know -it use to be Woodbridge but it may have changed.  He just stood there.  I asked- ""can you please find out?""  He said ""Oh yea - sure"".  We also have  no tableware - nor menu.
Can you spell I-N-E-P-T? 

He came back to take our drink orders and tell us about the drink specials.  I asked if we could see a menu  (mind you we are already  20 minutes into the evening. )  He laughed and attempted to make light of the fact that we had no tableware nor menu.

So while we are waiting - the waiter for the group of 8 women  seated directly behind  us  (from Chicago, based on their very loud conversation) was telling them a story about  God knows what.  He talked very loudly and kept saying  ""those Black guys"" in his monologue.  There happened to be a couple (black gentleman with his white companion) nearby who could not help but overhear this guy's  very racist dribble and appeared to become very uncomfortable.  The women sat silently and said nothing.  I was about to interrupt him  and tell him that his conversation was rude and to please stop when he ended his rant and left.

The wine list is from HELL- How can a purported fine dining establishment even entertain the thought of having Sutter Home White Zinfandel ($23/bottle)  and Little Penguin Cabernet - ($34/bottle) on the menu?  What a joke - not to mention rip-off
 
About the food.......
The veal dishes we had were ok.  Although the veal (Satimboca and Marsala) were tender, both dishes were very salty.  However, the vegetables were fresh and tender and the potato slices tender.  The bread is hot  but nothing to rave over.  We stuck to one glass of red wine each from the Glass Only wine menu as the bottle menu was lacking and way overpriced. 
 We ended  the meal  splitting  the Tiramisou which was very good and supposedly homemade on the premises.

By the time we left @  8:30 p.m. the place was busy with only 3 empty tables. My son and I could not figure out how this place stays in business considering the poor service and mediocre food/overpriced and  low end wine selection.    Bill for two came to $113 and with our $50 coupon ended up paying  $82 (including tip) .  Way overpriced.  

Trust me -  we will NEVER return to this TWILIGHT ZONE again and if you are wise you won't even begin to venture into it...."
128347,"We boarded our dogs here for July 4th weekend only because every place else was booked up.  First, the location is industrial which is fine I suppose.  Second, the front office is very messy and disorganized.  The owner was working the front desk and is not very personable.  I had to give her my information repeatedly as she could not properly type my information into the computer.

There is religious and anti-Obama, anti-muslim, racist paraphenelia hanging all over the walls.  If we hadn't been so desperate to find boarding, I would have walked out.

The dogs stayed nearly a week and we had to pay for basic grooming; whereas, with our usual boarding at Ann Road Animal Hospital, they do basic grooming every 3 days without any extra charge."
128479,The food is OK is not bad but is not the best sea food neither the decoration as many mexicans restaurants is scandalous the biggest problem here is too loud there is a band playing live terrible music that I can't even talk to my wife or place my order to my waitress really...I'm Mexican so don't say I'm being racist  IT SAYS IT'S A RESTAURANT NOT A BAR OR A CLUB you came here to eat in peace not to dance for God's sake besides there is an army of people trying to sell you illegals copies of movies and all kind of things. ...I THINK IM GOING TO TRY TO SELL EARPLUGS HERE AND START MY OWN BUSINESS
129276,I went in for a simple check engine diagnosis so I could buy the parts.  I got to the front of the line where I was told to go to the back of the line.  The back of a line I began in.  So basically they told me I had to wait until every customer left the store to get help.  They're worthless and racist against white people stay away.
129431,"So it seems like this Target is a bit on the ghetto side. First time I came here the cashier/manager said I can not purchase more then 1 sale item. Which was BS I called Target and they said there is no such policy. Maybe the guy didn't like me or was racist towards me or something I dunno.  
2nd trip here 2 cashiers, 3 customers, and manager on duty was arguing about fake coupons the customers was trying to use etc.. There was a lot of yelling and slowing the line down. sigh
3rd trip here nothing happened which was good. The store is clean & stocked. But not a lot of works around to ask for help."
130297,"Rude mexican girl named Jasmine- seems to give poor service to Caucasians. Actually, everyone there was rude. Only to the Caucasians though. Ridiculous. I wont go back to that company with obvious racist employees."
135833,"I'm posting an update. I went into this Walmart around 2 AM, I was craving something sweet. Once again, this is the closest Walmart, if I didn't have to go there, I wouldn't. I went in and I'm zoning out on what I want. I thought I wanted ice cream but being lactose intolerant, it's not such a great idea. I was spacing out and one of the employees came up. Usually I expect an employee to say ""hi, how may I help you"" but instead he just says ""what you never seen a black guy before, huh white boy."" I was in shock. If it was a stranger, well that's his fault to think in the year 2014 that I was a racist loser but no, it was a WALMART EMPLOYEE. I was in shock, so much shock and so I just looked at him with the ""are you serious"" facial expression look on my face. I hate this Walmart and some of the employees. I see them always goofing around and not doing anything. I hope I never return here again. It might be the closest one to my house but still it's not worth it. This place needs a lot of work. 

Tips: They have over 20 check out sections, only 2 are open with a small item for buying liquor check out open sometimes. Sometimes the lines are 20+ people deep.

Most of the employees are just straight up rude. They don't care unless you hand them their paycheck.

The place is ALWAYS a nightmare. Constant fights over the dumbest items. 

The self check out is open for a certain amount of time. It either closes are 9 or 10 o clock. Even then before hand, they block it off. I still have 15 minutes to use it, please I want to use it, not wait 45 minutes to check out.

The security check every single persons bags, no reason to close self check out which usually 24 hours at every other Walmart.

The list goes on.

I hate this place."
135941,Great food. But for whatever reason owner has  really racist attitude with actual Indians. Not sure why. Twice I went there and left 20% tip but every single time as soon as he will see us or for that matter any other indian family visiting vegas you can see On his face. Don't racially profile people. I must say that this is best chat samosa we ever had in US.
137448,"Stayed in the courtyard for 4 nights , First room was horrible, Found cockroaches in our room was then moved to another room. Had a mixup with room service and tried to fix the problem they wouldn't have it though. Phil was very rude and racist , Told me ""do you even speak English"" found that very rude. Was planning on staying here once a year for the festival might just look somewhere else."
146199,"I came here for the Speedo®s ....

However, there are no true Speedo® briefs to be found anywhere here ....

What gives? 

Is this America or what? 

(Actually, that rhetorical question does not work in this case being that the majority of U.S. Americans are overweight and lacking the machismo to flaunt it in a Speedo®.)

Fuck ....

This is like a Timberland® store with no boots; a Starbucks® with no coffee; a Barneys New York® not being blatantly racist against African Americans. 
 
Someone call me when they actually sell Speedo®s here.

147334,"This was by far the worst shopping experience EVER! Stopped by the deli for some deli meats and cheese. Which I do quite often. Today I placed my order with BERTHA she was by far the rudest piece of scum I  have ever come across. Ask for my meats to be cut about a quarter of an inch. She asked what number I said I  didn't know that's just how I usually order. Never had an issue or been asked that before. She cut them, showed me and they were fine. Then I heard her and her coworker talking. She was complaining because I didn't order with a number. When the cowork ask who, she said the ""cholo"" right there. I am french Canadian, 50plus year old female dressed in my work uniform. To call me cholo or any other racist comment was completely out of line. Then the lady on the side me ask for .6 of a pound of meat. Her coworker was taking care of her and BERTHA said oh she shops at Walmart that's how they order there.  I turned and looked at the woman, she looked at me and shook her head. Yes I  could has asked for a manager and believe me I thought of it. But putting the word out there is so much better.  This place sucks and I will take my business and hopefully yours if you're reading this elsewhere."
148292,"I was just in the store with my fiancé looking for shoes and accessories. It would have been a fine experience, except for the racist remarks/conversation going on between sales associates. 

It started with a somewhat daft, but innocent conversation. Associate A asked if someone is Lebanese, where are they from. Then Associate B responded ""Lebanon"". Then Associate A responds ""Where is Lebanon"", to which Associate B said ""The Middle East, near Iraq"". THEN....best part... they banter between each other saying things like ""Oh so you're a terrorist then!"" and they laugh thinking it's really funny.

The thing is, it's not funny. At all. It's rude, it's ignorant, it is incredibly racist. Just because you are middle eastern, does not mean you're a terrorist. Period.

If a manager would like to get in touch with me to discuss the names of these associates, because I have them, I'm happy to do so."

(BE GOOD TO YOUR CUSTOMERS) I wont spend a Dime in my life again i spent thousands and that's the attitude i got..the look from the lady of i'm gonna steal something..smh racism you gotta love it...there is ignorant folks in every race here is the white ones
154915,"I'm currently staying at this hotel.  I'm paying $48/night, so maybe I shouldn't complain, but this place is so god-awful that I can't help it.  My hotel room is decent.  Everything is fairly clean and comfortable.  The casino itself is full of low-life people.  I tried to watch a football game earlier tonight in their pathetic little sportsbook and had to put up with drunk thugs who were screaming racist and homophobic slurs because the game wasn't going their way.  The average age of the people who come to this casino is probably in the 50s, and most of them look like they can't really afford to be gambling away their money in the first place.  This hotel is several miles away from the main Las Vegas Strip, and it's in a disgusting part of town.  I think I passed three thrift stores once I got off the freeway.  My hotel window overlooks the back part of a Wal-Mart.  

If all you need is a clean place to sleep and shower, this place will work for you.  If you're on vacation, pay a few dollars more and stay at a better place."

The staff here is the worst I have ever seen in any ""BUISNESS"". Jan Mieggs is by far the worst individual at this school. I was out of class for 4 days due to severe illness and surgery. I showed Medical Documentation for an excused absense. I completed the entire course except 2 weeks of back of the house restaraunt rotation. Due to the RACIST MEXICANT Chef in that class, who i told i would be missing 3 days and can i come in after class for a week and make up work. He said ""I DONT GIVE MAKE UP WORK ""BRO"""" YOU HAVE TO BE HERE EVERYDAY TO PASS MY CLASS"" I told him I couldn't, I have medical needs and that have been at this school for 15 months working my tail off..and your going to fail me? he said ""ITS NOT MY PROBLEM"" Let me remind you, my lease on my appartment is up, i have no where to go...i get 4 hours of sleep a night. after this class, im moving back to MD. I have a deadline. They did not care, its not their problem they already have their money from Sallie Mae. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU ONLY YOUR MONEY!. SEVERAL, SEVERAL! times i was taken out of class in the middle of lecture...By financial aid reps, asking me when i would be able to pay them...ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? Still to this day, I have not recieved a diploma, or been responded to the 50 emails and messages i have left the school admin. They did not care that i spent 14 months at that school and 2weeks left, some racist chef wanted to take my life in his hands...they take my federal tax return and are trying to take my benificiary money from my fathers death...how pathetic this school is. ALSO, The school fired 50% of the staff, and got rid of my program. They only offer a 20 thousand dollar ""CULINARY CERTIFICATE"" now...GET REAL!!"

I usually hate getting haircuts since I end up at home in tears the next day trying to style or fix my hair after a cut.  Jen cut, color and put highlights in my hair. It turned out perfect! I was going to get my nails done and waxing too, but while I was getting the color put on my hair I could hear the ""nail ladies"" from across the salon making fun of Asians. I suppose they couldn't tell I am part Asian.   I normally would NEVER step foot in this place again, but Jen is the best of the best.  I just hope she moves somewhere else."
164145,"The workers working there had bad attitude. They are so racist and give you a bad face despite your are their customer. Although the view is nice, but they made the trip a worst nightmare.

Such rudeness and racist is unacceptable. No second time."

171572,"Cabs in Pittsburgh are not like cabs in other cities.  In Chicago, cabs are part of the transportation landscape.  You go stand outside and hail one.  Maybe you have to walk to a busy corner, but whatever, you can find one.  Not so, in Pittsburgh.  On the rare occasion you see a cab, it's already got somebody inside, and you need to call.  Fine.  One more reason the transit here is a total fail.

So I need to get downtown on a Saturday morning by 8 am.  I call a little after 7:15 and ask if I can get a cab to pick me up at 7:45.  No can do, the dispatcher says - you can't reserve times.  You call when you are ready and then the cab is dispatched.  She also told me this after I was on hold for 10 minutes so I was already cranky.

Maybe this is common practice - is it?  But it's really annoying.  I had no idea how long it would take the cab to get to me - if I called when I was ""ready,"" the cab might take forever and I'd be late.  if I call before I'm ready the cab might be early and either charge me for waiting, or just leave.  But I took a chance and called around 7:30.  The lady on the phone said it'd be about 20-30 minutes and I was SO angry - I CALLED 20-30 minutes before and you told me to call when I was READY and now I'm READY and now I have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WHAAAAAAAAAAT.

Fortunately, a cab was dispatched and got to me within 5 minutes which was a total surprise, but I managed to get my stuff together and get out the door when he arrived. Seriously - don't say 20 minutes and then it's 5 minutes. People need accurate information!

So I get in the cab, and the very chatty driver proceeds to be a complete jerk.  It takes maybe 10-12 minutes to get  me downtown, and in that time he proceeded to make fun of Indian people by doing a fake accent - charming.  And then he used the word ""b*tch"" twice to refer to women.  Joked about kidnapping the actress who plays Hermione Granger and bringing her home to his kids and commanding her, ""do a spell, b*tch!""  And using the B-word to describe women who call cabs the morning after a one-night stand.

Maybe if I'd been saying racist and sexist things, it would've made sense for him to join right in, but he just said this stuff out of the blue, unprompted.  I was so offended, but when I'm in the cab of person like that, I don't feel comfortable saying anything since we're essentially alone.  But I tell you - if I ever get a cab again and he's the driver, I'd say forget it.  I'm tempted to call and complain - this guy was the worst.  I got to my destination on time at least, which is a relief since I'd hate to spend one more minute with him than I'd have to.

Yuck.  I don't ever want to take a cab in this city again, and I'd go out of my way to avoid doing so if this is what their service is like."
171655,"Horrible place to work. 
Everybody is always in a grumpy mood. 
I had a mechanic once curse me out because I didn't close the doors in the shop. 
And by service, they don't give two shits about it. This company depends on its drivers to lease out its vehicles, it's doesn't profit from the public at all. 
I was giving yellow cab over 1200 dollars a week minus the gas to rent out their cabbies. 
Horrible place to work for & one of the worst cab rides you can ask for. 
The racist stuff I heard at this place was horrible and everybody is so divided and at each other's throats. 

Yellow cab is going down and it's taking the old Yellow Assholes with them."
179103,"If you're looking for an opportunity to travel back in time, this is the perfect place to go!  My boyfriend and I are trying new places considering he was recently transferred here for work. We definitely had a good time looking at the photos and admiring the old-school feel that the restaurant has to offer.  The onion rings are a must have - order with their tartar sauce and you'll thank me. Their tartar sauce is very small for the price, but if you aren't a heavy dipper you'll be fine. The burgers aren't anything to brag about, but they were still delicious. The produce used was very fresh which is always a plus. The fries are standard. Service wasn't as good as I would've hoped for it to be. I expected younger women in 50s clothing (that would've been awesome), but the carhops were older men - probably in their 60s; one of which (our initial server) was very polite, but he never came back to ask how we were doing or how everything was. We buzzed back in to get a free refill of iced tea and the second car hop assisted us. He wasn't very polite to us. I'm not saying that I'm racist by any means, but he was extremely considerate towards the African American community during our visit. 

Long story short, I'm not fully pleased with our service, the food was ok (onion rings were super crunchy and cooked to perfection)!  I definitely expected more."
181606,I would never get my nails done here ever again. They are racist Nail salon. The owner of the salon asked me something very offensive about black people. The owner just wants your money. Their service isn't worth your time or money.
182316,"Food: the food was good, my only complaint is that they use the bare minimum when it comes to there ingredients. You really don't get the full effect of the Thai dishes. If it you want better portions & consistency, this is not the place.
Service: I waited until my second time eating here to make my review and this is the conclusion that iv come to. 
 The service is lacking N HERE's WHY!
1. The workers look at you like you're  crazy when u walk in instead of asking how many ppl and where would we like to sit. 
2. I also Noticed that they separate the Caucasian ppl from the rest (non-white), by sitting anyone of ethic background outside when there's plenty of room to sit in doors. Not sure how Asians can be racist or bias to any group of ppl. But I seen it with my own eyes.
3. They never check back with us once the food came out. You have to physically track one of the workers down or go the the desk to and ask for a refill or napkins ect. 

Like I said I never like to write a bad review and always try to give the facility to make up for their lack or service, quality of food and professionalism. We all have bad days but it shouldn't be consistent, not if you want returning customers."
185938,"This bar was a lot of fun! I loved the cheap/reasonably priced drinks, I loved the diverse crowd. I can't speak for the food since I ate elsewhere before the bar but overall atmosphere gets 5 stars. One thing I would like to say, this place needs to check who they allow to play live music in there. The guys who played Saturday 3/1, Kevin Marshall and Scott Sutton, were incredibly racist and made no qualms about it in their songs. I'm a white guy and I was extremely offended by their ignorance. If you read this, Big Al's, don't let these a-holes play in your bar anymore. Also, they were way too loud. Good bar for a night out with friends, just check the schedule for live music and make sure the aforementioned ""musicians"" aren't there."
189248,"I'm a Madison native and have been to Jolly Bob's a few times. It's not a terrible place, but tonight as I was walking in I saw a long dress code. I thought it was a joke at first, because in addition to ""no doo-rag"", they said that no white shirts were allowed. I thought they couldn't be serious.

That is, until I got turned away at the door. I'm a white guy, but I can recognize that policies like this are clearly racist. They're trying to keep out 'ghetto' guys and have ended up with a laughable dress code. I honestly felt like I was in the '50s and segregation was in full force - it was just a bizarre, sad experience, especially after living in Brazil for 3 years.

Add to this the fact that as I stood there at the door trying to get my sister's attention, I saw a woman in a white shirt and pointed her out to the bouncer. ""The code is only for men"" he said. O.....K..... that makes a lot of sense.

This is a racist policy that people shouldn't support. I'm definitely not going in there again - no matter what I'm wearing."

190940,"I loved this place when I was a kid, their noodles and soups were always my favorites.
I came back recently with my husband who has never been to the restaurant I raved about. Trying to recreate my delightful experiences i had growing up I ordered some noodle soup, my husband ordered a dish called 'salted fish'.
Our order came and the salted fish wasn't what he had expected, and to me the fish was the ocean equivalent of eating limburger cheese. This dish could have been 'salted fish' but my husband didnt want it. So he politely asked if it could be taken back, the waiter went to speak with the manager... well this somehow offended the manager, and he very angrily said he would not take it back, and since he was with an ""oriental' - im filipina by the way- he should have known what the salted fish would be.

so sad. i used to like this place until i knew the manager was a crotchety racist a$$hole."
191332,"I love this comedy club.  The people there are always friendly.  The price is definitely worth the money.

198738,"So I've been meaning to write an update to this. To be fair, My Florist is not my favorite spot in Phoenix - far from it actually. But it is really close to where I live and my best friend loves going there and drinking wine. But I wanted to share what I thought would be a downer but ended up being good. 

There was a waiter who made a racist comment to me and two of my friends. And we talked to him about it and he didn't seem to understand why his comment was inappropriate. My friend was extremely offended by this and went in the next day to talk to the manager. 

At first, the manager was somewhat like 'big deal' and this was obviously infuriating. So we assured them that we nor anyone we knew would return until it was resolved. But then my friend got a phone call and I guess they had a change of heart and put the waiter on leave/probation for his comments. So go My Florist for responding to ridiculously inappropriate behavior of staff!! 

(I do hope that the waiter gets it, learns from it, and gets his job back!!)"
198925,"I thought the food was yummy and the service was average. I will be going back for more! I also thought ""melissa g's"" comment below was incredibly racist and unhelpful. Shame on her."
200123,"Now I know that most folks who live here have either never heard of this combination or thought of it as some racist stereotype but Lo Lo's serves up the best fried chicken in AZ along with a side of waffles and a cup of syrup like you've never tasted before. The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.

You'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated. You will not find this kind of food elsewhere in Phoenix."
200595,"As a former Atlanta resident and a forever lover of the South and all its delicious food, racist people and humid weather it has to offer- it was my absolute pleasure to bring my friend to his first ever Chicken & Waffle meal.

Although the Scottsdale location is closer to my house, I insisted on my 25min drive to downtown Phoenix to eat at this Lolos because I refused to eat C&W at a place surrounded by floppy hats, leftover nightclub makeup and eating disorders. I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. ""Thats what I want to be like!"" I cried, super giddy with excitement. 

We got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.

As our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. ""What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!"". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:

************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ 

As he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.

After that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the ""what are gizzards made of?"" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.

As we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. ""I don't think I can eat any more"" said one person. ""WE MUST FINISH THIS"" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory. As soon as we sat in my car and turned the car on I grabbed my stomach and said ""I'm sorry, I need to do this""- *takes off belt. ""OOOHHHH GOD. MUCHH BETTER"". I regret nothing."
200709,"Ok.. So I had to call one of my African American friends and ask him ""What the HELL is so goddam special about Lo-Los?!!"" To which he Literally laughed out loud and said ""NOTHING!!""

I knew he would have been and have some type of input. He had, and he did. No! I am not racist or stereotyping anyone! I know he loves Fried chicken and would give me an honest opinion.  He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me ""you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation."" 

This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  

Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!

The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. 

The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. 

It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it. 

This place sucks. Seriously. Its much to do about NOTHING. 

I recommend a name change. Lo-Lo's Hi-Hi. Low low quality and high high prices."
203286,"Amazing! Believe the hype. Everything was delicious. Not to sound racist but we knew were good when we saw Vietnamese folks eating here. We are not Vietnamese food experts but the pho and spring rolls  were some of the best we have ever had.  
The Pièce de résistance: macaroons and ice cream alone is worth the trip.  Thai tea ice cream is now my favorite flavor. I almost ate the plates. Like everyone else, I highly recommended 43rd Express."
204265,"If you enjoy being scammed by employees who do not honor coupons or prices that they posted on big huge signs, this is the place for you! 

Came here with a coupon for 50% off clearance computers applicable in store only that I printed off of Staples.com on the day it was valid. I found a computer marked CLEARANCE, great, this should be pretty straight forward? 

Not unless you are dealing with JOEY the lady who I guess was the manager on duty at the time! According to her, clearance means she jacks up the price back to full retail and then applies my coupon! I had no idea retail price and clearance prices meant the same thing, this must be a new thing staples is trying out, clearance things for retail price! This probably explains why they are doing so awesomely as a company! 

Or better yet, it may explain why their stores are closing and they are doing horribly because their managers are apparently not competent enough to handle scanning a coupon during a sale that is initiated by their own corporate office!  

Here is a great idea Staples... hire some managers who know how to manage! Not people who try and BS their way out of selling you something in the store because it is just too good of a deal. I mean it would really benefit a company that wants to stay open and sell their stuff to have customers and not alienate the people who come in trying to buy stuff! I am not a retail expert by any means, but a little bit of common sense tells me stores who are shitty to their customers tend to loose their customers, unless you're Apple, which you're not, just FYI.  Maybe JOEY wanted to keep that computer for herself? That seems like what really happened, she did not want to sell it to me because she figured she could keep it and sell it herself later when her paycheck comes in? 

I mean the only other thing I can think of is that maybe it is because I was middle eastern! Maybe they were being racist and do not sell to my type there? Hmm, I digress. 

TL;DR Just skip this place and let it close down as it should have a long time ago. You can pretty much get anything on Amazon you would find here on a day to day basis and you do not have to deal with incompetent ""managers"" who try to bully you instead of honoring their own prices."
206703,Horrible doctors office they make you wait forever staff rude my doctor's semi-nice I wasn't able to see her on one appointment they assigned me to a different doctor for that one appointment and this guy was a jerk did everything including call me a drug seeker and accuse me of sallying my prescription drugs on on the street just because I am Hispanic I suffer from depression panic attacks and anxiety attacks and he accused me of selling my anxiety medicine on the street telling me they have to street value that is the reason why I ask for so much of my medication I need my medicine to help me with my anxiety and panic attacks & then says he won't give me any more.

Although, this is the most ghetto Church's Chicken in town."
209993,"When I was here, I got heat stroke. There was a party in the back room, and everyone was crowding the bathrooms and I was sick. It sucked. 

While out in the restaurant, I had ordered a carne asada quesadilla. It sat and waited for me, as did the rest of the group. We came here to watch the last Lakers vs. Suns game. And yes, I did get to see the Suns lose in their home town. That was cool. (Los Suns jerseys or not, they aren't doing much to help end the hate there). 

The quesadilla tasted like a cheeseburger when I finally did get around to eating and stomaching it. I wasn't a fan of that. 

....@#$! AZ and their racist laws."
210792,"I told my self I would stop going to this place when racist comments where made to one of my coworkers but decided to give it another try, they sat us down and for 10 minutes no one asked what we would like to drink or anything. Ended up walking out. Never returning to this place."

The chicken taste like they wiped it across the bathroom floors and the customer service, dont get me started on the customer service. Not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon? I have to read a fucken Spanish dictionary before i walk in this fucken place. Overall i'd eat there again. It was alright.."
220988,"Went there today looking for some new Wet n Wild eyeshadow quads which they didn't have in yet.  Thought, hey I wonder if they have any NYX products.  So, I asked the employee who'd been following me and watching me like a hawk since I got into the cosmetics department -middle aged caucasian brunette - and she narrowed her eyes at me and said ""no, that's dollar store stuff!"" then smirked.  WTF..can the attitude lady.  They sell it at Ulta and Target..although not high-end, it's not dollar store.  Incidentally that was a yes or no question.  What a great way to start my birthday..with an embittered racist minimum wage employee.  Won't be shopping here in the future; though I live nearby."
230053,"Came here with a friend on a tuesday when they do 'Gold Fish Racing'. The lady who MC's the whole thing was extremely vulgar and offensive. If you enjoy seeing people made fun with racist and sexist comments and jokes, you might enjoy this place, until you become the target of the remarks."
233243,"I want to give places the benefit of the doubt. Especially ones that have positive reviews, have been recommended by locals and have been around awhile even with heavy competition close by and a fairly pricey menu. So when our first round of drinks took 15 minutes to arrive, and our old fashioned was made incorrectly (a place like this with an expansive bar should know how to make an old fashioned, yes?), I reminded myself that the food was supposed to be awesome. We were on vacation, with good friends and were prepared to have a great evening so I really was not looking to spoil it for myself. 

And then our waiter opened his mouth. I asked for some explanation of menu items, many of which had either no explanation or description or was a puzzling mess of adjectives and much-too-hip-and-cool titles.  When asked for some help to decipher parts of the menu that - while it appeared to be in English - might as well have been written in a foreign language, our waiter started in with a host of racist remarks - like maybe he could find his Vietnamese friend to interpret for me, or go get me some dim sum instead. When I didn't laugh, he asked what I wanted an explanation of but I was so over it. He returned to the table after a few minutes, likely feeling slightly remorseful about his inappropriate comments (or more likely trying to resurrect his shrinking tip potential) and started rattling off at 100mph a verbal dissertation of a few menu items. No one at our table could understand much of what he said. I guess he was having a bad night and unfortunately it did rub off some on us. One bright star was the manager who came by to drop off a list of breakfast and lunch places he wanted to recommend after having had a conversation about this with our friends before our arrival. We did not mention our waiter - no one wanted to have a negative conversation and further spoil what was supposed to be a fun evening.  

As for the food, well, it's hard to be fair given the bitter palate created by the waiter. I had the mini mushroom pan fry (serious potential, but slightly greasy and sadly under salted) and a salad (which was ""fine""). My husband had the swordfish (butter sauce was yummy), our friends the bison meatloaf and the filet mignon. Both were pretty good. Desserts earned higher praise, allowing me to move Cowboy Ciao up to 2 stars - bread pudding, ice cream trio and the birthday cake were all delicious and a satisfying end to an otherwise disappointing experience. 

I would not recommend Cowboy Ciao to anyone visiting the Scottsdale - there are too many fabulous restaurants in this area to waste time with poorly trained staff."
246541,"I came here on a Tuesday. I love to go bargain hunting on my days off so naturally I stopped here. I walked in and it looks clean. There is a bit of clutter, but I blame it on the location size. It's so small and I feel bad that all the associates have to cram all of the stuff in this small location. It was a particularly busy time of day, however this sweet lady named Rosana told me to wait a few minutes while she helped out other people (I'm a pretty patient person). So I took the time to browse. 15 minutes passed and I still didn't get helped, and I could understand, there is a super long line of people and only 2 people working the counter. The only reason I'm not mad, is because I know how stores work and if anything I blame corporate. Anyway, I was helped by Bridget and Rosana and Luisa at some point and love them all. I really dislike racist people that do these reviews because I think all of these people are sweet and kind and have helped me with awesome buys!! I always buy my Electronics from here!! Anyway this is my review from what I have seen the past few months! Awesome place."
248729,"How does this place have anything more than a 1 star rating? Let's start off with why you SHOULD NOT eat here.

1.) The food is garbage. Probably a literal statement, too. I've eaten here twice, just because I believe in second chances and MAYBE my first time was a one off thing. NOPE. I ordered their Phoenix & Dragon dish the first time, which had zero flavor. I mean, at all. You could boil a piece of college ruled paper and get a better experience for your taste buds. The second time I decided to order what I thought was orange chicken. Let me tell you, if that is what orange chicken is, then I've been lied to for years. What I ate was a fried ball of batter with a piece of chicken no bigger than that you would find in a can of chicken noodle soup inside, drenched in some sort of sauce that is horrid enough to make you throw up upon receiving the dish. I'm fairly certain their food is just microwavable dinners you pick up at Fry's. Why? Because I've seen the ""manager"" carry about 8 bags full of them into the restaurant. How can you even call this food?

2.) The staff/service is worse than what I imagine you would get in prison. Every person there is rude, save for one little Asian lady. I like her. My main concern is the bald guy who calls himself the manager or owner or what have you. I don't think I've been in his establishment, no, the parking lot of Fry's without wanting to smack him. This guy is reason enough not to go, but I'll get more into that in a bit. Bartender? What a joke. Sure, $1.50 Bud Lights is awesome, but I'd rather buy a 6 pack and catch a buzz watching paint dry than have to sit there and listen to that guy talk. Holy ignorance. I'm 95% sure he's nothing more than a racist bigot/lookout (more into the lookout part coming up). Seriously, he's just a prick.

3.) This is my final reason. If you still are considering this place so far, you're about to think a third time. I'd be willing to bet my life savings that this place is a front for drug laundering. Seriously. Back to baldy. He's had the cops called on him MULTIPLE TIMES for dealing in front of the place with the local druggies and even some cab drivers. I've actually witnessed that. I've also witnessed him around 9:30-10pm, running around the Fry's parking lot just absolutely drugged out of his mind. He sings, screams at people, talks to himself, etc. Basically anything you'd expect a druggie to do. Don't believe me? Fine, go in there at night and tell me he's not on something. The cops have been there multiple times, including for him harassing employees of the neighboring establishments while he's under the influence. He definitely missed the D.A.R.E. seminar in gradeschool.

So, those are my reasons that you should avoid this place. Unless you're into drugs and harassment or posting hilarious Instagram/Vine/Facebook videos of people out of their minds, then go crazy."
250725,"My family uses Tempe St. Luke's because it is very close to home but we will drive to Phoenix St. Luke's if we have to after how we were treated! My wife was having chest pains so we went to have her get checked out. We had our 7 & 5 year olds with us and we filled out paperwork and waited for a while (about 20 mins or so) before she went in to see the nurse taking vitals. I was sitting in the waiting room with one of our daughters that was a sleep so I was slower getting up to go with my wife. When i knocked on the door to go back there was no answer so I spoke to a admitting person to see if she could let me back with my wife and she said no because I had my daughter. I told her I have had her back there before when we have been there in the past but she still said no. I said ok and sat back down when my wife came out with our other daughter for me to watch and she went back and after a while had passed she didn't come back out like what we have experienced in the past.

I knew because my wife was there because of chest pains that she would be admitted and then transfered by ambulance to Phoenix St. Luke's so I was ready for that. My wife then asked the nurse if we could come back to her bed to say goodbye and for us to workout details while she was in the hospital and the head nurse (the one who took the vitals) said that we couldn't be brought back because we had 18 people waiting with us and that was too many! We didn't have 18 people with us, we had myself and 2 little girls. Now there was a lot of people in the waiting area and many were latin (Mexican) and she made it sound very racist against people with families in the ER.

My wife spoke to her (head nurse) and told her we are a family of 4 and that's it and to say what she said was offensive on all levels and if that's the way we were going to be treated then we can go to another hospital! There was no apology from anyone on staff and if this is how the medical staff at Tempe St. Luke's is treating people we will not be back for any medical services at all.

So don't go there unless you like being insulted during a medical emergency or you have someone in need of care because surely won't get any care or compassion here and that's no lie!!!"
250865,"Sooooo, there's a lot on my mind.  The economy is in terrible condition.  We're being labeled as racists, we're still mired in multiple wars, I really want the Heat to suck this year but am afraid they won't, I think I'm gaining weight, losing my hair, and I am certain that my right foot is bigger than my left.

But you know the worst thing about my life right now?

No meat.  If only I was talking about the musical group, but alas.  My father passed away last week so to respect Buddhist beliefs, no meat for 49 days.  So what is a bacon guzzling, sausage stuffing ( shame on you for having a dirty mind!), carnivorous soul going to do?

Eat at Lalibela Cafe of course!  

Walking in, I was a little wary of the $50 authentic Ethiopian attire in a basket as you walk in.  Better not be a tourist trap, I am thinking.  Continuing to look around, it felt a little cluttered but not too much so, with some interesting art and more clothing on the walls to peruse.  I was running a little behind on time as I had originally intended to go to Byblos which was closed for renovations until August 20th, so I cut short my examination of the decor to order.  

I ordered the Vegetarian Sampler (7.99), which is your choice of 3 out of 5 dishes to go along with the injera or rice.  I also had the Yekemem Shai (2.50) black tea with cinnamon, cardamom & cloves cold, which was a refreshing drink. 

The Masir Wat, red split lentils simmered in hot sauce and herbs, was delicious and made me not miss meat so much, with a texture reminiscent of ground beef and a spicy flavor that was subtle but satisfying.  Tikil gomen, lightly spiced cabbage, carrots and potatoes was also a winner, with an almost buttery finish.  Gomen, chopped collard greens cooked with garlic and onions was the only component that was merely okay, with the flavors being a little too mild for my taste, but by no means bad.  The injera itself was a quiet partner in the backdrop of all these flavors, slightly sour and spongy.

While no one checked in on my meal, no one had to, as I was quite pleased and didn't need a refill.  The initial service was fast and efficient as well, even with only 2 on the waitstaff and about 15 people coming in right around when I did.

So you know what?  Our economy is going to recover.  I might be a little racist but who isn't?   Wars are just disagreements taken too far, Lebron will remain crownless, I'm just big-boned, there's always Rogaine or a toupee, and I can always get custom shoes where the right is bigger than the left, and I have Lalibela Cafe to thank for putting me in this frame of mind.

Thanks for a great lunch, and I'll be back often, meat or no meat!"
253316,"Horrible horrible, customer service. Never coming back again. Food was ok nothing special. Got cut off after 3 drinks, which was terrible. I truly believe waitress was racist for us being brown. Stay away from this place if you value self respect. Waitress name is Jordan. Stay away from this place."
253657,"You have got to be fucking kidding me. 
There was no one in the restaurant. the place was a graveyard, yet no one thought it was important to wipe the tables or even sweep the floor. Crumbs and sticky stains everywhere. i ordered take-out before I got a good look at the place. While I waited for my order I looked around for a place to sit - no clean chairs. All had crumbs on them. Tables had folded-up pieces of cardboard shoved underneath the legs, balancing them out. One table had THREE cardboard balancers. All the chairs have chipped paint. There are stacks of sodas with a stained apron tossed onto the top of them - better wipe those bitches down good before you slurp, people!! The license on the wall reads 2008. HOLY GOD THIS IS 2010!
There is a BED that's not even hidden from view. Toothbrush and toothpaste and a shoerack! Damn, put that in the BACK ROOM not the FRONT if you so desperately need to do it. And give me a break - how busy can this place possibly get, that you need to sleep there overnight??? I shudder to think what the back kitchen looks like if they can't even pretend to make the dining area presentable. 
Even my dog wouldnt eat there... but since he's missing a leg, he might need to steer clear of this place before they try to stew him up. BTW I AM ASIAN so keep the racist accusations to yourselves, white weirdos. 
Okay, all joking aside: the place is GODDAMN DIRTY. PERIOD."
256263,"Unfortunately there isn't a lower rating for this joke of a bar. 

Al the owner is an unbelievable douche bag, surly with customers and slow with service. Not only did he drop racist comments about Asians, he would describe his violations and covering them up for the inspectors (who was a female Asian). 

Answering questions like ""how have you been al"" answered with a snide comment and a rude attitude. It's clear he gives zero fucks about the bar itself, his staff and even his customers. I will not be going back and urge you to support another local establishment."
258287,"This is an extremely racist office. Almost everyone working here has a name like Hernandez, Rameriez, Martinez. I asked a worker why, he  stated the managers name is Garcia and he perfers it that way. There were a couple black people working there, no white people. Talk about reverse racisism. By the way, they have moved their office to Sunset Road. Very nice office."
258844,"Worst casino management in Henderson, Nevada. I use to praise them on their restaurant but now they seem to be racist company. They allowed a waitress to work there and last night this waitress accused me and a friend who is a business owner of motel down the street of trying to get over with a slice a pie which he purchased a pie and we split it. That was racial profiling which in Henderson that happens very often. Other than that their restaurant is not a good place to eat if you have a strict diet of no pork. That contributes to high blood pressure. I personally don't eat red meat or beef anymore. The cheap breakfast doesn't provide an alternative like Denny's does."
260049,"Ahhh the Lotus. An old-Henderson must! The service is fast and friendly. They have good specials and decent food. Don't go here if you are looking for a 5 star place. Go here if you want a great casual dinning experience with greasy American-Chinese food and a sweet little Chinese waitress who will say, ""Ah yes, ok, ok, dank you."" It's not racist - I adore her!"
266610,"Stayed there last night, have to say, ive been to many places, and the pool is awesome. The beds were comfortable, the rooms just redone, however a little pricy at 150$ after taxes for a room with two small beds. First off, the pool closes at 10pm, and thats just wrong for a city that never sleeps. The women there were mediocre. The food was also mediocre at a high price. The drinks? Well, let me tell you my story. So i left my room about 11pm, with 40$, went down to the bar near the exit by fremont street, at the lowest level of the casino. This is where i had the worst service in my life. I sat down, and waited 15 minutes waving and yelling trying to flag down one of the bartenders, who kept making eye contact, but passing by, finally, he asked what I wanted, I told him makers mark on the rocks and asked him how much, to which he replied he could not comp the drink, and then walked away without taking my order for another 15 minutes. with a super annoying attitude like he was racist against me or my father inlaw who is hispanic. I didnt ask for it to be comped, i was going to pay straight up with a 20$ bill and leave him a tip, however i decided to hell with him, and put the money in the machine so I could ""Get comped"". So i asked the gentlemen sitting next to me if service is always this bad, and he was from london, and said he had just arrived, i complained that the bartender with the mustache was being rude, so he then flagged down the man and told him to get me a drink, i wa astonished that he payed attention, but the british man was gray haired and in his 60s, he me got service immediately. Then the bar tender pointed to the plaq on the machine which read, to get comped drinks you must put a $20 in, and be playing $1.00 per round, which i was doing, and i told the bartender i put 20 in and are currently playing a dollar hand, he then rolled his eyes and made my drink, which i downed immediately because he pissed me off, huge mistake, worst customer service, he didnt come take an order for another 20 minutes, i was getting really angry, he pushed a large black trash can right infront of me, and was throwing beer bottles from across the room breaking glas right infrontofme and my father inlaw. Finally he came by and gave me another drink, i still had 5$ in the machine after i had finished the drink, i kept flagging him down but he kept walking by, so if he wouldntserve me i refused to play until he took my order, when he walked up and said and pointed at the plaq again, and told me i have to put 20 in and be betting a dollar, repeating what he said eairler, and he wentback to breaking glass infront of our face from acrosstheroom. I was very irritated so i kept playing and flagging him down, i had $1.25 left, and i got him to talkto me. Finally after beingthere for an hour he said he wouldnt serve me because i only had $1.00 currently in play and .25 cents left. The plaq didnt say that, thats not the rules, so i finished my bet and left, i almost waited aroundfor him to get off work. It was a complete waste of time and money. Exceptthe pool. Which was still a waste of time causeitcloses. At 10pm. I hope management reads this and does something because no one should be throwing bottleslike that. He was about 55-65 years old, white balding head, white moustache, old white man about 5feet 7 inches tall. The bar at the rear entrance near the tables. For thisyou. Get 1 star"
270588,"Well this place was a surprise!  Driving around doing store checks all day, we bumped into this place right around lunch time.  I am highly knowledgeable in the cheesesteak genre and highly critical of places that don't get it right.

Pride of Philly (POPs) gets it right.  This has to be the best cheesesteak in Las Vegas (I may be wrong but I don't think so).  The bread, key ingredient in the cheesesteak genre, was excellent.  Had a side of greasy, hot and crispy fries. 

Don't like cheesesteak, they have pastrami, grinders, and fried string beans.

Best thing about it was Steve, the cook, nice guy and not a racist like that Geno character in South Philadelphia."
273701,"I was approached by a bartender of Calico's, Keith, who informed me that he was not racist and that he didn't appreciate that I wrote on Yelp a comment saying that the bartenders of Calico's are. He told me to go back on Yelp and write that he is NOT racist. I didn't recall writing it at the time he mentioned it but now that I have a chance to look at it, not under the influence of alcohol, (talk about a buzz kill) I am proud to say that YES I did write it. 

I never said that the bartenders are racist. As a matter of fact, if you read it, it says the opposite. Anne is probably the best bartender there. There are others that are good also but I really cannot remember their names. I tried to make my comment general but I see that is not going to work so I will just name names. Chad is the bartender that gives customers a hard time and he is the bartender that walked away from my brothers and me at the bar. Keith was the bartender that finally took our drink order.

Yes, I have always had issues at Calico Jack's and I still went there anyway because of my friends.

This is crazy... I hope this makes you happy Keith. Again shame on me for going back there...the things I do for other people."
276200,"Certain items are good, breakfast for the most part. I've tried to go several times because there close to the house and wanted a regular spot. Whenever I called to order I was treated as though I was a bother and felt very rushed. Each time I went in I was treated with a lot of attitude, and for all the wrong reasons! Word on the street is that there a bit on the racist side........ Don't let the one black bartender fool you, I felt like I was in 1890"
277131,"There were a lot of problems with this place. After repeating my order three times because my waiter just couldn't get it right, my order still came out wrong. I notice the waiter struggle with taking my order so I repeated my order in Spanish (not bc I'm racist - for that person that felt the need to attack me on that) but because I had no problem being patient and making sure he got my order right. And he managed to mess up the table next to us (maybe he was new?) We went at a time that wasn't busy but felt he was all over the place but couldn't really manage to get anything right. 

How does a Mexican restaurant get Tacos so wrong? This place manages to do just that. The food itself was horrible. We came here as it was highly recommended to be the best Mex Restaurant in Vegas but were highly disappointed w the food itself. 

And to top it off we had to wait a very long time to get our check. Only reason we left a tip was for the bus boys who manages to keep up with our refills. Our waiter just took our orders, managed to screw our orders and we had to track him down for our check. (Not exaggerating - my husband had to track him down bc he neglected to come by our table to check on us) If you are looking for a decent Mex Restaurant than try to avoid this place. It sucks!





As some are offended for my review then just ignore it and go because you enjoy this place so much. I write my review based on MY experience and don't appreciate haters hating bc they don't agree. YELP is meant to voice your opinion on businesses as everyone has different experiences. 

Fortunately, I've had great Mexican food and I don't believe this was one of them. Forget about the bad service we received but the food was just not good."
280567,"They need to hire better dealers. There are very rude and cranky people working as dealers in there and if you're going to take a chance at loosing your money at least do it happily. I don't know how they allow such rudeness towards players. I always treat people kindly and only came out to try my luck and have a good time. I left feeling crappy not cause I lost but more because I was treated poorly and yelled at by a dealer making snide comments for no real reason. Maybe he was racist against asians or just hates women, I don't know, but he doesn't deserve that job."
282384,"Nevada energy crawled across my fence to install a new meter on Saturday knowing that I would not be home Nevada energy meter man saw a mezuzah at my front door and Their meter person crawled over my fence like a slimy sleaze bag wrote on my back door where he install the new meter without my permission and illegally Crawled and left his footprints over my fence wrote the KKK with a crucifix this happen Saturday the 14th it is  1245 and I will never forget what they wrote on my door.
If you're Hispanic if you're black if you're Jewish if you're Catholic if you're Christian watch out for Nevada energy The most racist company in the world."
283615,"Stopped in here on the Burgh, Bits, and Bites tour.  We met the owner Robert Wholey, who told a really unsavory racist joke.  I was not happy.  Being a born and bred Pittsburgh native I was embarrassed people like him still exist.  Needless to say I won't ever be going back.  I noticed several other people on yelp have already commented on this, so obviously this wasn't the first time, nor the last."
288177,"Is somewhat of a 'fairy tale' coffee joint - out of a movie/magazine type atmosphere. Kept getting cooler and cooler as I asked more questions about their store, walked around, etc. 

Great coffee experience and they were roasting while I was there which added to the vibe. 

Only downer is that Biff's (think back to the future with me) run amuck in this place  - I was wearing business attire and you would have thought I was yelling racist remarks with the looks I was getting. Sorda funny to me, just see that getting to me if I was a local."
292808,"Horrible place, I'm not judging based on my gambling but on prices and availability of food and drinks. First off room service is non existent I tried for over an hour to get through to someone and nothing, second all prices on food and drink in the restaurants are more than twice than it should be plus I believe I heard quite an excessive amount of racist slurs from the staff which made me more than uncomfortable. I recommend people stay away from this cesspool as and I insist upon that with upmost sincerity."
303336,"I feel like a racist when I eat here.  Maybe it's the panda bear dressed as Pancho Villa.  Maybe it's the REST of the name (Chino Bandido Takee-Outee).  Maybe it's the fact that I giggled when I saw both.  I don't know.  I just feel bad about it.

That said, the food is actually pretty good.  It certainly won't blow your mind, but getting a Chinese chicken dish with Spanish rice is an experience to savor.  The snickerdoodle is cool, too.  One big drawback?  An incomparably confusing ordering system that leaves even Mensa minds with a headache.  

For better or worse, this is a restaurant that has never heard the word, ""no."""
303479,"Fried food, trashy decor, a part of greater Phoenix that you'd have no reason being in...It's greasy spoon eating at its best!

I stopped at this place on the way to a vacation in Sedona since it's off the highway toward Sedona. It was recommended by Drive-In's, Diner's, and Dives, a.k.a. Triple-D, so I figure it couldn't be too bad.

Just don't call it Chinese. Don't even call it Mexican. But it's darn good food!

There's lots of good variety, and all the dishes are really unique and tasty. Don't know what to get? Ask the order-taker for a sample. Everything I had was good.

And I love the restaurant's devotion to its suggestively racist mascot, a panda with a sombrero, long mustache, and ammunition sash, Pancho Villa-style. They even have a freaking statue of him in the middle of the restaurant, standing proud and tall, as if he were a Buddha waiting for restaurant patrons to bow down to him or present him offerings of Diablo Chicken and Snickerdoodles. All is good though, it only adds to the restaurant's eclectic-ness."
303672,"Yo, you like Chinese food right? And of course you love Mexican food, you're in Arizona. Then you will LOVE this place. The wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them. You can get Jade Chicken in a burrito! Or in a quesadilla! Even if you don't want to combine Mexican food with Chinese food, eating them in a more traditional (?) way is still an amazing treat. 

You can take the food to go and sit down inside. The restaurant setting is a little bare bones but they bring your food to your table so it comes out even? You also get a free cookie so that's awesome!

Possibly the best thing about this place is the mascot. It's probably the most racist mascot ever. Panda wearing a sombrero with six shooter. Ridiculous and I love it"
303734,"I've been coming to Chino Bandido Takee-Outee, vaguely racist name and all, since high school. It's nice to know that some things never change. The Mexican-Carribbean-Chinese menu never changes, and neither does the flavor.

If you're a newcomer let them know, they have samples. Get in line, fill out a form with what you want to eat, pay at the counter, and take a seat. My standard order is a jerk chicken/hengrenade chicken combo with jerk fried rice and black beans. Any of their entrees are available as burritos or quesadillas. Sadly, I can no longer get these because of the damned gluten thing, but you should try it. Their tortillas are fantastic.

A combo with two entrees, beans, rice, a drink and one of their famous snickerdoodle cookies costs around $8. It really doesn't get better than this for that price. I had to knock them down a star because they don't have enough restrooms for the size of the space and because the last couple times I was there the food had cooled somewhat before it made it out to our table, but it's really good, even cooled down."
303740,"My arteries hate this place, but fortunately they don't get to make decisions.

So many things to love:
1) you can sample their signature dishes
2) combo options- 2 item + side or 1 item + side
3) Carnitas and jade red chicken
4) COOKIES- the volcano, a chocolate fudge snickerdoodle
5) kitschy interior with blatantly racist decor (a giant panda with a sombrero)
6) no frills, hole-in-the-wall vibe

If the most delicious hole-in-the-wall taqueria and your favorite Chinese take-out spot had a baby, it would be a fat sombrero-wearing Panda named Chino Bandido."
308532,"I was apprehensive about this bar--a country music biker bar is not typically the most welcoming place for minorities. But I went anyway and actually found myself having fun. At least I was, until the bartender grabbed a bullhorn and launched into a racist rant about Mexicans. Thanks, Hogs and Heifers, for confirming all my worst stereotypes."
314058,"Thanks for the heads up trigger...

A friend of mine on February 28th, 2008  who's a local African-American businessman, owner of a high-end marketing firm working with reputable clients in television, product, fashion and more, was shown racist behavior at this club.

He was with four of his Caucasian business partners they were let in, but he wasn't. When staff were asked why he wasn't allowed in the doorman replied, ""I can't let you in with baggy clothes and chains and (expletive deleted).""  That's funny cause he was wearing a button down shirt, sweater vest, dress shoes and no jewelry and his partners where in t-shirts and sneakers.  Sounds like racism to me.

Not cool!"
316789,"This was the low point of our  week long stay in Scottsdale.

It's a good thing this place is closing. Not only is it dirty and the food meh (as other reviewers have noted), but we had a horribly racist experience.  It was shocking. If they weren't going to close, we'd report it.  As it is,we are just letting other Yelpers know, because it is totally unacceptable in this day and age."
326993,My mother and I just had dinner at the Brazilian Bull and the service was down right racist and disrespectful. Especially the owner. I will never eat at this establishment again and will tell everyone I know to avoid this place!
340995,"This is the only racist bar in Pittsburgh! I was there with my American friends and the bouncer or some idiot who worked there just came up to our table and asked me to leave. When I asked why, he said he didn't need a reason. Then my friends argued with him and said he can't do that and then he says that I was drunk and so I have to go. We had just had 1 beer that night! I was completely ok! And even if I was drunk, I was just sitting with my friends and talking. That's no reason to throw someone out of a bar! I left and decided never to go to this piece of crap again."

If you're female avoid the smoking corner, you'll get trapped by creeps asking for smokes and making racist jokes to impress you. Never coming back again. Really disappointed in what the art area has to offer. Drinks are also overpriced."

She wasn't in the casino for more than a minute when she was told to ""take this off"" while making a circle with his finger around his face. She said no, that it is a part of her religion, and he persisted by yelling ""take it off or I will throw you out."" She said no, and he grabbed her, picked her up off the ground and carried her outside forcefully. We went inside to talk to the manager, but he insisted that they politely asked her just to take her hood off. These people are racist pieces of sh*t."

There are Hispanics working here all the gardeners dishwashers and housekeepers are Hispanic but that it. Arizona and the Hilton there racism is well defined it is only focused towards Hispanics I repeat only towards Hispanics . I asked about staying a third night to avoid driving the next day on Mother's Day Saturday over the phone I was told $172 and the next day I was told In person  $190 if they could find a room . A House keeping worker (Hispanic) told me they were at 70% occupancy which means they have a bunch of spare rooms .  There are other things which I will save in hopes that the Hilton contacts me .

QT. I don't even know what the Q or the T means. But this place beats 7-11 and AM PM hands down. Huge parking area. Lots of gas pumps. Assorted bums and snot faced teens. Uber friendly and uber efficient staff. Clean. Clean. Clean. Free air and water for your car. Those yummy Totino frozen pizzas. Every kind of Dorito known to mankind. Assorted bums and snot faced teens. And really, the staff, English speaking. As a first language. I don't mean that as a racist remark, it's just nice when you're in a hurry, and your'e just trying to get your Tecate, Frito's and Bubble Yum and there's no communication barrier. QT. My little convienent cutey store. Oh, hey, maybe that's what it means. Hmmm...."
393527,"I hardly ever post a review on any company not unless their customer service is extremely horrible or there has been a chain of events that I was unhappy with. In this case it is both for the Canyon Apartments so I thought it would be best to warn as many people as possible to not rent here. They have taken over new ownership as of January 2013 and nothing has changed for the better here including the rude, stuck up customer service you receive from the leasing agents and manager. They advertise this property as a gated community but as of 3/21/13 the gates still don't work and haven't for about a year. There is very limited parking if you have more than one vehicle expect a lot of headaches finding a spot that is not covered. Since the gates don't work you can expect people that don't even live here to be cutting through the complex at all hours of the day, night and early morning. Some people drive very fast up and down the parking lanes. They are now leaving the gates surrounding the main pool completely unlocked during business hours which I'm sure is a city code violation. I thought renting an apartment on the Canyon side with all of upgrades would possibly mean that there would be middle class families living in nearby apartments but it has been the complete opposite with punk kids sitting on the stairs late at night being loud. It doesn't surprise me anymore to be walking through the complex and smelling strong odor of weed. All of the reviews below this one are very true and accurate. I laugh they show people apartments while taking them for rides on the Hummer golf carts and they think that is suppose to sale the property to people. I have tried to think of one nice thing to say about this property but I honestly can't think of one thing. There new policy to pay your rent is either a cashiers check which costs $5.00 from most banks or you can go to their website and put all of your banking information into and it costs $2.00 and they no longer accept money orders since they said they were receiving falsified money orders. Now I'm not the brightest person in the world but I have asked my bank and other people that work in the banking industry and they have never heard of anyone falsifying a money order. They just decided to do this because they figure people will want to save a few bucks d just pay their rent on their website and they will make a couple bucks per resident that does so. In the past week a couple vehicles have been vandalized with one having eggs thrown on it and the other having spray paint on the passenger door on a newer vehicle. Also there is only a couple handicap  parking spots here on the canyon side and they are constantly used by people that think they can park anywhere they want. Now that it is warming up people are starting to use the main pool and I walked through the gated area that was completely unlocked and saw the usual large groups of families using the pool which looked like they were using it as more of a bath tub than a swimming pool. I'm not racist by any means but this place is ghetto at night and the quality of people that are moving in here are reason enough to break a lease and pay the penalties."
393800,"What a foolish excuse; it's run more like a carnival than a business. 
I've gone their for years. Today I couldn't communicate to the detailers to roll my windows down a bit to wipe the window edges. I walked up to the manager, ""Dustin,"" with my five dollar tip in my hand and said, ""I'd love to tip someone if I could get them to wipe off my window edges.""
Dustin first let me know that, ""hey, they don't speak English, so what do you want?"" (with a grin and a dismissive shrug). 
Then he let me know that it was against owner's policy  and that he would lose his job if he had the window edges wiped. I said I thought that was ridiculous. 
THEN he said if ""you want the window edges wiped that's a two dollar charge.  You have to pay two dollars for that.""  This was silly, especially because I'm standing there holding a $5 bill I'm trying to give someone. 
At that point the little guy was up in my face and was very confrontational. So I said that I know BS when I hear it, and the verbal exchange went downhill from there. 
Needless to say, I didn't get my window edges wiped and the staff didn't get a tip. 
I just think its odd that a so-called ""business"" owner would encourage his staff to be so obnoxious over trivial stuff; but from the other comments it sounds like the owner is an incredible jerk and that certainly is communicated by his staff. 
The other revolting attitude was the racist contempt Dustin and his assistants have for the Hispanic detailers; that really came through loud and clear. 
We have this gigantic immigration problem caused by business owners hiring illegals. Then, rather than being grateful for inexpensive, hardworking help they cultivate this abusive attitude toward them. These superior and arrogant white guys are shameful and disgusting in their attitudes. 
Don't waste your time and money on this bunch of racist carnies. They are as nasty to their staff as they will be to you."
393809,"Evidently no change. 
Still the underbelly of racist hypocritical American business; cultivating the use of illegals while screaming for deportation and prosecution of the unfortunates they employ."
394035,"I had been into this spa a handful of times over the past few years because there is one lady who does a decent eyebrow wax here.  One day, I decided to stop in for a pedicure.  The lady who did my nails is probably the one other reviewers here mentioned, but I need to point out that she is not Russian, but Armenian.  I know this because almost from the moment I sat down the woman engaged me in unwelcome and inappropriate conversations about race and ethnicity.  She told me to send my black friends to her, that she used to work in LA, and black women would come to her with awful skin and she was the one person who could fix it.  She also asked me where all the black people go to listen to music--which clubs, she meant.  When I asked her why she wanted to know, she said because when it comes to jazz music, black people would know what music is the best and most authentic.  Feeling more and more uncomfortable, I just said, ""OK, I understand that.""  She worked in silence for a few moments, then out of the blue said to me ""I know what you think.  You think I ask because I want a black man."" Then she proceeds to tell me how racist black women are.  I was sitting there ready to cry.  I didn't know whether to get up or just let her finish.  I ended up sitting there, and eventually she shut up and left me alone.  I had told her her comments were inappropriate, and she responded, ""Well, you started it.""  Are you kidding me?!!!  I just go to get my nails done, not even to make conversation.  I would have been plenty happy if she just smiled and did my nails and let me go on about my business.  I don't know why some people see a black person and get this diarrhea of the mouth and feel the need to express any feelings or opinions they have ever had about race.  No customer should have to be subjected to that.  VERY inappropriate for a place of business.  When I shop in the area, I don't even look in the direction of this place!!!"
403610,"This place used to be really cool then somewhere along the line some genius thought it would be appropriate to attempt to turn a decent place located in a working class neighbourhood into a swanky ""Scottsdale Club"". 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for the betterment of any venue. Especially one that I have frequented since the Bobby Magee's era with the lowered dance floor. But when management starts to nitpick about trivial clothing details it's time for me to pull a LeBron and take my talents (and friends... and money) elsewhere.

There have been a couple of notable ""wardrobe malfunction"" incidents with my friends over the years. In one incident the door guy deemed it necessary to reject entrance to my friend because his jeans were supposedly ""too baggy"" I'm sure the Bag-o-meter wasn't properly calibrated for an accurate reading. who decides what is baggy and what isn't? ...I personally think it was my friends cornrows. Let's be real. Albeit a decent guy with a job and manners he probably looked too thuggy for the ""high class"" Q Lounge. But I digress. Let's fast forward a few years and talk about the time another one of my friends was turned down because of his shirt. Well, we go around the corner to K-Mart and purchase a button down dress shirt with a collar. We proceed to the entrance only for this gem of a doorman to deny my buddy once again, this time b/c the shirt he just bought was too big. :-) Damn, ya gotta love these clowns. The latest incident was when I was denied access because my $200 jeans had manufactured rips in them (see exhibit A) ...no soup for me I guess. Rocket Scientist, they're called ""distressed jeans"" and believe it or not it's a current fashion.

So, needless to say I think it's time I part ways with the ole Q Lounge and their little Napoleon of a ""Pro-Mexican"" manager. I'm sure going to miss having my birthday party there and having the staff pretend to take pictures of my entourage that will never be posted on their website. Oddly, there is plenty of room for Spanish-speaking individuals. I'm not a racist I'm just calling it the way I see it.

Okay, let's finalize this. This club is not Scottsdale! ... as much as they would like it to be. It's in a Blue Collar area with patrons that reflect that. They can and will continuously add silly items to the dress code to fit their profiling objectives. Yes, it's all a guise so they can PROFILE certain individuals. Haven't you heard that you can dress a pig in a tuxedo but it's still a pig. If they are concerned about security they should hire more police. The manager seems to favor Spanish-speaking individuals. I'm just going to leave it at that. There are too many decent places that are quickly sprouting up in this area that one could go to then to contend with the Door Nazis and Mngr R2D2 at Q Lounge. Happy travels and don't drink and drive. ;-)

That's my review! From an educated, articulate and well-spoken individual."
414320,"I posted a review before and I am pretty sure the cab company flagged it because it was quoting some of the racist comments their cab driver said to me. But I will be posting it again because they have done NOTHING to rectify the situation. Cab driver in car #5428 who is a bald Indian man with glasses told me to go ""f*** myself and that I should watch my mouth ni**er"" because I noticed that he was taking us the longer way to drive up the meter. I called thier office to report them and they just apologized and refused to give me the cab driver's license number to report him to authorities. Then a woman named Nicole responded to my previous yelp review asking for details like the date 2/15 and the time it occurred around 9pm we were picked up from The Venetian and a 10 minute trip(according to the GPS directions that my phone suggested that night ( turned into almost 30 minutes. This is a despicable cab company who has racists working for them and they do NOTHING about it. Nicole, I am still waiting to hear how you plan to handle the situation and still waiting for his cab license information. Thank you!"
424252,"Items Selected:
Beso
Cacahuate
Oreja
Carrot Cake
Guava Cheese Turnover
Tres Leches
Cheese Cornbread

Continuing to weave a path through Las Vegas' ethnic pastry shops it was just after 4:30pm that a stop was made at West Charleston's Panaderia Y Pasteleria Latina, the pastries confirmed to all be made in house by a Spanish speaking colleague but the service as disheveled as the shop itself, a small market with all sorts of novelty items at the left while the bakery and kitchen comprise the other half, no labels found on any of the goods and the ladies behind the counter busy chatting and making themselves coffee while offering the bare minimum of help.

Thankfully accustomed to some of the items, though further research afterward was necessary to determine their proper names, it was with $9 even exchanged for eight items that goods were bagged before making way to the parking lot, a replacement slice of carrot cake requested when the middle-aged woman decided to spin and flip the plastic clamshell container within the bag.

Bordering on racist in their behavior to my presence after watching the staff of Panaderia Y Pasteleria Latina greet parties both before and after with warm smiles and plenty of help, it was with pictures taken that first bites of the turnover showed the unexpectedly sour cream cheese to complete overwhelm the bright red layer of guava, a distinctly different off-putting flavor marring the 2-for-1 ""Peanut and Cream"" Cacahuates with dough so dry that two small bites left the mouth completely parched for saliva.

More successful with a block of cornbread that saw fresh cheese enliven the otherwise sweet and toothsome base, and likewise with the familiar Oreja that riffed on a palmier or crispy elephant ear, it was again in pronounced dryness that the granulated sugar Beso did dwell, the half moistened by cream at the very least edible while the other was left for rats or airborn fowl.

Hoping that cakes would at least offer a textural upgrade on the pastries it was finally in two of a half-dozen options that plastic spoon was plunged, and although the carrot cake was serviceable if not memorable the tres leches was actually an excellent representation of the milk-soaked classic, the jam helping to offset a top sweet like fondant while the white cake layers were separated by lightly whipped ribbons of cream and an additional layer of guava.

** Setting aside issues of service that really did strike me as more than just disinterested or rude the bargain basement prices at Panaderia Y Pasteleria Latina simply aren't enough to justify the general low quality of the product in general, not with better locations just a few miles up the road."
430782,Yea this pub is really nice too bad the owner is racist. Me and my buddies were having a good time in this pub til one of the bartenders told us that we had to leave. That same bartender even apologized in advance before telling us that we were kicked out. When asked why we were being kicked out the only explanation we got is its the owners bar. Why I say he is racist because the rest of the people who were in the bar that were more loud and rowdy then us were white like he was. Come on dude. The 2 bartenders that work for the racist owner were really cool. They both were polite and even said Sorry that we were being kicked out. So yea I found out that bar owner's name is Tommy. So yea everybody stop by this bar and tell him to grow the fuck up and stop being a racist.
430862,"-10 stars. They sit there and let their racist karaoke leader mock customers and get into altercations and shove women who are patrons of the bar. He has assaulted our our family by physically shoving  the hat of my brother deeper onto his head instigating a fight between a big group of people. This bar only supports their "" regulars"" and do not make new customers feel welcomed."
431831,"Their pho is excellent and I hate to say it but... I've gotten the vibe that they're racist here at Pho Avina. I am white and every time I went here in the past the waiters were really slow. After a waiter finally arrives to my table they would then take a while to get my food and drinks out and they wouldn't come back to check up on me. Even getting the check was a process and it took quite a while. I noticed that Asian people are greeted right away here, they are served quickly and the staff is overly friendly with them. I really hate to bring race into my review but I'm not the only one that feels this way. I took my family and friends here a few times and everyone agreed and noticed that Asian people get better treatment than whites here. This happened to me every time I dined here so it wasn't just a one time thing either."
432959,"my wife and i are extremely picky about japanese food--it's our favorite cuisine.  we have eaten sushi, teppan, and robata from san francisco to tokyo.  En is as good as it gets.  and how lucky are we that it's the closest japanese restaurant to our house?!  unlike the very racist reviewer below who basically said that a korean run place can't make good sushi, we don't care WHO makes the food as long as it's GOOD.  and this place is FANTASTIC.  our kids love it, and we love it.  their fish is fresh--surprise surprise, that happens to be important--unlike the ethnicity of the sushi chef.  the tofu is HOMEMADE--if you like agedashi tofu, En's homemade version is a delight.  not many places serve robata grill food and en's is excellent.  the service is very friendly and we've become such regulars that the wait staff know exactly what our kids order every single time.  when we leave for vacation we always look forward to coming back home and having a meal at en.  

A good meal is a good meal and friendly service is friendly service.  Our favorite japanese restaurant in the world happens to be in henderson, NV.  nothing wrong with that food snobs!"
437557,I overheard a male manager and female employee making very rude and racist remarks about chinese culture. This sort of behavior is ignorant and unacceptable in any situation. I found it to be extremely offensive and refuse to visit this location ever again.
445323,"I have only ordered out from Sakura. The place is always drab and empty no matter what time it is. The staff are always sitting around doing nothing. It really sucks to go in the restaurant. Their ""hibachi"" is a freaking joke. Do not expect to get normal hibachi dinners here, in fact, expect absolute crap! Their ""regular"" Asian menu is joketasiticly inferior to many of the other Asian choices in Squirrel Hill and cost almost the same. The staff seem nice, but jump when any customer walks through the door as if they are not expecting anyone. Now (and please excuse any conceived racist under tones. I assure you I am just stating pure fact), I have had my order screwed up over the phone almost every time I order from Sakura. I understand that you do not need to speak fluent English to take a delivery order, but you should know the menu. Yesterday, My wife and I ordered from there (very inexpensive for a weekday meal) I ordered my sushi correctly, even going over my order 3 times with the woman on the phone. When the food arrived(promptly), our bill was for $70!!!! And as if fleeing from the scene before we could find out, the delivery guy didn't give us a receipt. Upon opening my order, I found that they had quadrupled my order AND CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!!! I called to complain and the woman, who I could barley understand refused to accept that she made a mistake. I became a bit belligerent and she called over her manager. All I could hear was him explaining something in Japanese and the phone girl going ""OOOHHHHHH?!"" over and over. She DID make a mistake and I was awarded free sushi and my money back. Still, when I said I would be there tomorrow to get the proof of the credit to my card, she initially refused!!????? The manger in the background must of shaken his head or something because she finally agreed. All I want is my damn food for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! But...

Their sushi lunch specials are the best I have ever seen. for $3.99 you have your choice of 6 different kinds of rolls; great for a late day snack (you can order up until 3pm). But...

This is another sushi place that claims to have tuna rolls when they are Fatty tuna rolls, but charge for regular lean tuna. Also order early or you WILL get stuck with day old, been-sitting-around-all-day, hard fish. But...

Get them on a good day or early in the day and you will have adequate sushi for a competitive price."
447096,"We have been going to Mrs Whites for years now. We would go there as a treat every so often because there food was fantastic. Unfortunately it has really gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. Its really sad to, we loved Mrs Whites but not anymore. 
    The last couple times we went the food was pretty sub par. The portions were much smaller and the quality and taste was rather poor. A couple of times ago we went with myself, my mother and my brother. I dont want this to sound racist but I feel it needs to said. I felt like we were definitely the wrong color to be eating there. 
   The service was ok but i noticed it was much better for the ""locals"" who were there at the same time. We ordered and sat and waited for our meal. I watched as some of the people around me were brought the same thing I had ordered and it looked fantastic. Nice big pieces of chicken with large portions of sides. 
    Well finally our food came and what a disappointment. Our portions were MUCH smaller then everyone elses and the sides were about half the size. My mother ordered catfish, (her favorite thing there) and it looked like it was half a filet. My smothered chicken was 2 very small wings and one small breast, (I had ordered all white meat) and there was very little gravy and cabbage. 
     I went ahead and tried Mrs Whites one last time a couple weeks ago and it was more of the same thing. I ordered the smothered chicken again and when it arrived I received 2 small wings and a back bone with no meat. The table right behind me had the same thing and received 2 large breasts and a nice sized wing. After attempting to eat the skin off the back bone I gave up and ate what little else there was on the plate. My mother did get a nice sized catfish filet but both our sides were very small. 
    I no longer recommend Mrs Whites. It looks like the kids have taken over running the place and I think thats the problem. The gentleman who was always in the kitchen did a wonderful job of making the place a great choice for fantastic food but i dont see him there much anymore. 
   Stay away from Mrs Whites unless you happen to be the right color. Very sad."
447147,"All I can say is ""What the hell""? I'm so embarrassed by some of the reviews that point out this is the best soul food they ever tasted.   They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again ""what the hell"".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, ""what the hell"".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.  Honestly people ""what the hell""?"
448253,Worse service in Charlotte and Racist Ass old Waitress who only was short with me from the beginning ! Manager was nice and accompanying and professional unlike this OLD should have retired years ago waitress name I did not catch cause I asked for another. Food was good and the rest of staff was just this one lady who Did not change my feeling of Charlotte which I was here for a week were great!! This one lady unfortunately played my pre conceived notions of racist south but the rest of the great people I met in Charlotte were great. Too bad people like this lady still exist and reason why this place is getting only 3 stars !  Funny Thing is I tipped big to the 2nd waitress as I always do so at-least I could teach the racist with monetary loss
448260,Disgusting place with disgusting service . I am a global traveller who has spent his time in 20 odd countries and 40+ different airports and this is the worst among all. It's a racist joint. I didn't want to rate even 1
453062,"I wanted to take time out of my day to write this review for my friends at D10. First let me say that there are some reviews on here that are not warranted. I am a gay-Hispanic male that's been coming here for years and I can say that the good people at D10 are far from being racist and a homophobe (especially Angie and Lisa). As for JB being accused of running the KKK, all I have to say is take a look around at the patrons and the men and women that run D10...point in case. Now as for the ""stumpy"" comment, you should be ashamed of yourself for being less than a human being. With that being said, let's get down to business. 

The atmosphere here at D10 is what you'd expect from a neighborhood dive bar. There are a lot of regulars (me included) as well as some fresh faces, great music ranging from Motown to county to top 40's. As for the food, they have recently updated their menu for the better. With new favorites like the shaved rib eye with horseradish or a classic such as Mel's green chili Mac n cheese. While we're at it, let's throw in my favorite the honey hot chicken wings. The brew selection is great with craft beers and seasonal brews, as well as the good old domestics. Bottom line, D10 is a great place to hang out and kill time or pull up a couple of bar stools with friends for drinks, food, and laughter."
453737,"This was surreal. For demographic purposes: we are in our late 30s/early 40s. Gordie Brown seems like a talented guy, I just wish he'd make the material his own. We got all the references, we just didn't find them funny. Some of the impressions were good, but the jokes fell flat. They were racist and/or mean-spirited, and seemed very elementary. And by ""elementary"", I mean ""elementary school"". 

Examples:
Asians can't say ""r"" and are always pushing the egg rolls (cringeworthy impression of a ""generic"" Asian woman- he went here....a lot). 
Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles are blind (hilarious!). Elton John is soooooo gay! 
Bill Clinton is a lecher! Cigar joke! 
George W. Bush is really dumb! He makes up words!
Arnold Schwarzenegger is foreign! 

I could go on, but no reason you should have to suffer too. It's a shame. He seems to have a good singing voice and some of his impressions were quite good. The longest 90 minutes I've experienced in a long time."
463826,"We requested a song from a black artist to be played. We were told no because club owner racist. He refuses to play music by a black artist. He even went as far as to take songs that are sung by black and white artists, and edit out the black artists in the song.

Besides the fact that who is even racist anymore in this day and age, the scene of the nightclub is associated with a music style which is primarily black artists. I didn't stay long enough to see, but I imagine their playlist is 20 eminent songs and Macklemores Thrift Shop on repeat.

Unless you're organising your local KKK meeting, stay away. Stay far away."
464821,"My plane landed at 1:30. My friend took me straight to Z'Tejas for lunch, where we started in on some margaritas. We then hit 2 other places, and ended up at Saddle Ranch around 6:00.

There is a mechanical bull.

A guy hit on us by telling us a racist joke as his opening line.

We then settled in by talking to 2 guys who kept their left hands in their pockets the entire time. Uh huh.

I'm so glad I wasn't sober when we walked in, or else I wouldn't have been able to handle it. The universe was looking out for me that day."
466227,"I placed an online order on 1-22-11 at approximately 8:45PM and was assigned a pick up time of 9:16PM. I arrived at the location and was told that my order had not been started because the employees forgot to check the fax for an online order. There was another customer there who called in her order, arrived 30 minutes after the call and they still had not started preparing her food and she was being ignored as well. It was not busy, when I arrived, the manager was leaning against a broom talking on her cell phone. The employees were just milling around and no food was being prepared. Additionally there were only 3 tables of customers who were all eating, thus no reason why food should be delayed.  

Once I realized it would be another 30 minutes before they could even get to my order I asked for a refund and was refused. I asked 2 additional times for a refund and was refused again by the manager (who is the owner's wife). She did not speak English (per her employees) and because I am African American assumed that I didn't speak Spanish. She proceeded to use racist and derogatory language regarding me and my request to her employees and in ear shot of the restaurant patrons. She referred to me using the slang for whore, fat pig, and the Spanish slang for the N----- word. I continued to request a refund at which time she called the owner Jose Arriola who informed me that I was not getting a refund nor was I getting my food order and even if I called GOD it wouldn't help the situation.

I repeated my request for a refund while repeating back his statements for clarification. While I was speaking Jose ended the call by hanging up in my face. Once he ended the call, I asked the female manager? again for a refund. By this time I have been in the restaurant for over 40 minutes. I was told by an employee that Jose was on his way to speak to me in person and to resolve the matter. Within 5 minutes Jose arrived and started a conversation with a friend of his for an additional 30 minutes. I was told in confidence by one of the employees that he was stalling on purpose in hopes that I would either leave without my money or food, or I would cause a scene which would give him reason to call the police.

I remained calm and continued to ask at 2 minute intervals for a refund. Finally Jose came to the counter and stated that I would get a refund via online and that he cannot and will not issue a refund in person. I requested something in writing that he agrees to process a refund and that the refund would be placed on my credit card by Monday. He provided me with an incomplete sentence on my receipt stating ""Refund order because of ASAP"" with his signature. 

My fear is that he is in fact not going to refund my money and will claim that I received my order. At this point I have filed a complaint with the Arizona AG's office and I am contacting my bank tomorrow (thankfully they are open on Sundays) to begin fraud proceedings. Needless to say I am NEVER eating at another Wingstop anywhere in the world and will encourage others to never eat there again. 

Beware if you go to the Wingstop on Dobson in Mesa, you may not get your food and you DEFINITELY will not get a refund."
471527,"Had a bad experience with this lady named Debra, 4/2/2014. My cousin is a member and he forgot his Amex card. We only realize at the counter that we forgot our cash and my Amex card. Debra started lecturing us. With my cousin's thick accent, she thought I didnt understand a single English word. After numerous eye rolling, and insults, she didnt scan the items. The atm's failed to spit out $300. She was very racist and verbally abusive. She was rushing because it was 8.30pm. This is how you treat your members?"
475685,"I used to LOVE this bar! They remodeled it from when I used to go. When I first started dating my BF and was new to Phoenix we used to go here a lot. The bartenders here were great! And they knew how to mix a drink! Especially the Asian woman, she was super nice and mixed one of the best sex on the beaches I have ever had! Kept me coming back, I also used to love the vibe of the bar, sometimes it got loud most of the time it was laid back during the summers since ASU students were probably back home.

I did have a particular incident which made me stop going so much when a fellow customer called me a ""colored girl"". I won't say he was racist nor will I say it was the bars fault because honestly he was hassling the bartender also. He was too drunk and talking out of the side of his neck, and his friend with him bless his heart.... but I didn't particular LIKE being in an environment where I was being offended and yet paying the same amount as the next guy. 

All in all this bar is good and well! I miss coming here, but I no longer live in Phoenix anymore so it's a thing of the past, but if your looking to stray off Mill this wouldn't be a bad place to come!"
479749,"I wish that I could give Fry's 0 stars. Let me set the stage: My 24 year old Costa Rican husband and I (22 and caucasian) need to run an errand to finish a construction job that we are working on.  After picking up the supplies that we need, we both feel hungry and decide to go to Fry's to get food at their deli.  Conveniently, we were able to do some grocery shopping as well, which included pantry staples and beer.  After spending 45 minutes in the store, we finally make it to checkout.  I hand over my id to the woman at the register (I am paying).  She then tells me that she needs to see my husband's id as well.  My husband did not have a wallet or any form of identification on him.  He left everything at the worksite. She tells me that it's a state law, which is b*******, because any other time we have gone into a grocery store here with other family members or friends no one has EVER asked to see more than one person's id. Fry's isn't a liquor store; you don't have to be 21 to enter and shop. Do they tell parents who go shopping with young children that they can't sell them beer because they are in the presence of minors?  Then I start to think: is this lady being a super racist and attempting to incarcerate my husband who is here LEGALLY based completely off of his looks? Yes.  Because I'm white and he's Latino, we can't possibly be an innocent couple going grocery shopping.  If I were there with my father or my brother, would they ask to see id? No. It has never happened before.  We left Fry's without making a single purchase, and I will NEVER visit there again for ANYTHING.  If I were bleeding to death, and the only place within 500 miles were a Fry's, I wouldn't even stop their to get bandages to stop the bleeding.  My husband and I are so offended.  We both left hungry, and had to stop at another restaurant to pick up lunch.  I still have to go out and do grocery shopping.  Fry's wasted my time.  I will never get that 45 minutes of my life back, and that happening threw off my entire day.  I have alerted my family as well, and they will never be shopping at Fry's again either."
481059,"Special hidden gem.  This place has been open since 2008 and has only 15 reviews.  I would have never hit this place up had it not been for a Groupon coupon ($7 for $15 in food)

This is Soul food at its finest.  We had their chicken and waffles which comes with one waffle and 3 whole chicken wings.  I made love to them chicken wings.  I don't leave any meat, skin, or cartilage on the bone.  The bone is sucked dry and rightfully so as it is perfectly seasonsed with the delicious cripsness.  The waffles are similar to Roscoe's in texture but the flavor was really good.  I wish the waffles were a little crisp but they are more of a pancake waffle texture.

In addition to the chicken and waffles, we tried their Grits which were butterty, rich, and went down smoothly with the Chicken and Waffles.  Throw in a side of greens and 2 drinks and w/o the Groupon it was only $21. 

Ok I'm not being racist here but you have to judge the food by its loyal customers.  For instance, if you go to a Korean restaurant and see 99% white people, it's probably not good....right?   As we walked into Gritz with all 9 of its tables, we were the only non-AA people there.   To me, that means I hit the jackpot when it comes to soul food.  Sorry....I had to go there....but it's true.  At least I'll say it :)

The owners were super nice and chatted with us about the food.  We told them we'll be back and for good reason.  Cheap, delicious, home comfort food at its finest.  Considering how much love M&M gets, Grifz Cafe should as well.  Be sure to check them out!"
482385,"I had a terrible customer experience at this location today which is franchise owned by a lady named Pam and her husband.  I went in to order a drink that I had ordered two days prior from the same store.  The lady who took my order was Pam.  She said she could not fill my order because she was told to stay away from special orders.  I asked if I could speak with the manager and she acted like she did not hear me.  After going back and forth I decided to order the Veggie Delight minus ginger.  Another cashier by the name of Gabriela came to the front to take my order, Pam was rude, pointed at me and said I don't know what she wants.  There was about 5 people behind me in line, so I placed my order and stood at the pick up counter.  They fixed my juice last and put ginger in my juice even though I requested none.  I asked who was the manager, and they gave me a name Dom.  Five minutes later another girl came from the back to refund my order.  I asked again who was the manager and she said she was.  I asked who was the owner and she said Pam and her husband.  I proceeded to tell her about the poor customer service.  She never apologized or offered to fix my drink.  I told the manager I felt like her staff was being racist and will never again come back to that establishment."
483951,"The Sushi was okay. Nothing super special. Customer Service wasn't that good, I'm so tired of dealing with racist businesses. And I don't feel they treated my party like everyone else. The food took forever and they said goodbye loud and nicely to everyone but my party, people of color. This is a diverse neighborhood and racism should not be tolerated."
486122,"This place could have been amazing, I'll never know.

My husband, who is vegetarian/vegan, and I, being Vietnamese, thought this would be a great place to try during our visit to PHX this past weekend. 

The trouble started when the owner, a white man, asked me why I didn't have a ""vietnamese nose"". I was taken aback, and did not know how to respond. I said, ""what do you mean?"" he replied, ""you know, wider and flatter. You know, my wife is Chinese and raised in Vietnam."" I was flabbergasted. I mean, I know he wasn't intending to be hurtful or borderline racist or whatnot, but it really bothered me that he felt he could say this to a complete stranger, let alone a patron in his restaurant, and that he felt justified simply because his wife is asian?? All I could muster up was ""uhhh you'll find that people can look a variety of ways.""  

I don't know, even though he apologized, my husband and I were left with a very bad taste in our mouths and we ended up leaving before we could order. 

The owner was just weird, unprofessional, and inappropriate. It doesn't matter if the food is good, we weren't even able to get to that point.  It all turned out great though, because we ended up going to Green (see my review) that was close by, and it ended up being even better."
489351,"This place really cracked me up with all the juxtapositions it had. First of all, this has to be the tiniest sit down restaurant I've ever been to. It was almost as if we were eating in a phone booth. That being said, it wasn't uncomfortable at all; just funny when you looked around and realized how small it was. Also, inspite of it's tininess, the furnishings and how it was decorated was really nice, like to the point where it was noticeable, and I really liked that. Also the food was absolutely amazing from the bread they brought out, to the pizza I had, to the calzone my friend had. They really really REALLY knew their way around an Italian kitchen. Which is funny to me because, not to be racist at all by any means, but there seemed to be only people who are Hispanic working there, which you don't usually expect to see, but even if they were Italian, they still exceeded my expectations of authentic cuisine and dining experience so I give them a lot of credit for being able to do that. And when I speak of authenticity, my minor in college was in Italian and based on that, I can vouch for them being more than competent in that dept. And for as great as the food was, the prices were totally fair too and that is probably the best $12 pizza you will find in the Phoenix area. It's definitely a hole in the wall type joint and the area it's in is nothing glamorous. The customers even seemed kinda rough looking and not the kind of people you would expect to see in a nice place like that (but otherwise very nice and cool people), but add all of that to the pile of juxtapositions to this place that have really caused me to like it all the more because of that and give it a well deserved 5 stars. Also our server was incredibly nice too. The only knock I would give it is that to get to the bathroom you have to go to the back in sort of the kitchen area, but there's not much they can really do about it since the place is so tiny and there's literally no other place they can put one. It is a nice bathroom though fwiw."
491182,"Besides the racist joke about all single mothers are black, my nipple piercing went fairly quickly. They hurt like hell but I like it."
495655,"So, a group of friends and I ATTEMPTED to go Suite to celebrate a birthday, after about 20 minutes of waiting in line, there was about 15 people ahead of our group in line and maybe another 10 or so behind us (mind you, at this time all the people in line are a minority of some sort); a white man with a green shirt and khaki pants comes out and approaches the line then tells everyone, ""Hey guys, we're currently at capacity and it may be over an hour before we can let anyone else in. I'd hate for you to spend all night in line."" The people behind us in line decided to walk away, then less than 5 minutes later 3 white women walk up behind us in line and the guy that JUST told us that ""we're currently at capacity"" walks up to them and asks, ""you're on 'the list', right?"", one of the girls responds, ""what?"" with a confused look so he repeats, ""you're on 'the list'?"" as he nods his head so she says, ""sure"" then he escorts them inside... Being as how the people ahead of us were all minorities and we too were a mixed group of black and Asians, were curious if the ""capacity"" just meant ""too many brown people"" so we waited a little longer to be sure. About 5-7 minutes later, 2 minority males get in line behind us followed by 2 white men, then the guy in the green shirt goes up to the 2 white men repeating the same question about ""the list"" and escorts them in...I'm not saying they are a racist establishment, but there is something VERY suspicious going on there. I will NEVER go back!!!!!!... I did have a great time at BUBBLE though and would recommend it over Suite any day"
497302,I like the food. Many TVs and it closes at 2am. Some of the food are good and some are tasteless. The first time I went there this waitress was really nice. Tonight I went there I experienced a racist waitress which was not nice.
500757,"they usually have everything that any othe subway would have. so consider my 3 stars as per other subways. the place is alright good seating, sub par subway smell, you know what i mean.

the only problems that i see are that the employees are predominantly russian, or rather from the stan former soviet republics. i'm racist and all but in this case it makes ordering slightly harder. still they are nice there.

i eat here all the time for lunch since i like sandwiches a lot. cheapest high quality sandwich footlong blt with tons of veggies and sweet onion sauce. veggies are free bro learn to like them higher calorie/dollar and much better nutrient/dollar. 6 inch go crazy its all cheap"
501838,"Seriously, this is the last place in Charlotte or pretty much in the world you would want to to visit. It's been moved three times. I've heard of brutal fights and shootings.

Then and friend and I visited this bar the other night and I got one word. GHETTO. Sorry if this sounds racist but I think was with a black friend with a gun and even he was nervous!

Not much else to say"
504554,"This outlet store of burberry is not the best place. I'm talking about customer service which was lacking. None of the sales persons greeted me or at least asked me if I needed help. Because of that, even if i wanted to buy shoes, i decided not to! Sales people were just chatting with each other. I noticed though, there was a white couple who entered the store after i did and they were greeted nicely. I say, people are pretty racist over there at north premium outlet burberry because when primm had a burberry store, i had a great service. Too bad they are not there anymore. This one at premium sucks. I will never shop there."
516609,"Been here a couple if times with my grandmother before, it's always packed and running 15 minutes behind schedule. If your appointment is at 8:30am, they will not get you in a room perhaps 8:50am. Then once you get a room you wait 20 minutes to see a doctor. 
Last visit, I accompanied my mom of 53 yrs. who got sent by her primary doctor because he was concerned for her because she had been having a high heart rate. We waited 25 minutes after her scheduled appointment then another 20 minutes for Dr. Stern to arrive. Once he arrived he was not a pleasant man at all. He was rude, disrespectful and non empathic. Honestly never met such a old racist asshole. After that visit, I certainly did not allow my mom to reschedule. 


IN OTHER WORDS. DO NOT GO HERE. ITS DIRTY, PEOPLE ARE RUDE, RUNNING EXTREMELY LATE AND INCONSIDERATE OF PEOPLE NEEDS!  APPOINTMENTS SHOULD BE UNNECESSARY HERE, SINCE THEY NEVER LET YOU IN ON YOUR SCHEDULE TIME."
531074,"They are crap.  Possibly racist against asians.

Supposed to be open 24 hours.  Walked up to the door.  Some guy sees me.  Both doors dont open.  Doors are locked.

So i begin walking to my car.

Then some old white dude walks up to the door.  Bam.  They rush to the door to let him in.  Wtf?!?!?!?

Been in n out of here at night because i began working around the area.  Never have they ever said hi or greeted me at the checkout.  Only once i was helped my a young kid at checkout.  That is all!

So besides the young college guy.  Everyone rlse there have crap customer service skills."
535067,"Was great food. loved the fried fish and Okra. The staff very friendly. 
My only problem was, I was the only white person in the place. The two young African American sitting next to me, were saying unbelievable racist rants about white people , not to themselves but very loud so I could hear it. The whole place heard it. No management intervened. Made me very uncomfortable and I will not go back."
539314,"This is one racist place! I'm a proud Asian. Some of my Asian friends and I went in to check it out. Some went use the restroom and the others went to the bars to buy drinks. One of the worker told one of my buddies that he and the rest of us didn't belong there. One friend got dragged and thrown out the back because the bouncer accused him of pissing in the corner of restroom. This was false accusation because he didn't do it. The bouncer was even there when it happened. He just wanted us out. 

Soon we rounded up our crew because we were treated like shit there and we didn't want the situation to escalate. One of our lady friend was at the counter ready to buy some drinks. The bartender comes by, not to say ""hi what would you like,"" but instead he told her that she needs to buy a drink in order to sit at the bar table and to even be in their ""fine"" establishment. She decided to buy a drink despite the unfriendliness of the bartender. Now imagine this. The two mix drinks she bought costed her $50 when it should've only costed around $7 per drink. RIDICULOUS! We were outraged and stormed out, some of us having to hold back a few of the angered friends. As we walked out the bouncers made sure we were out for good. If you are not white, don't go in there. And even if you are white, please know better not to support establishments such as Tiki Shack. It says a lot about the managements morality in how they run their business and treat their customers. They need to check the year they are living in."
539559,"I wish there was a negative number because they don't even deserve a single star I was going in for ice had a hot bottle of water it was a 110 degree weather the manager made a messed up comment the girl at the register said I have to pay for ice and in a very rude tone and wile walking out I herd a snide comment from the manager it was racist and I will never forget it and all my friends family anyone else don't eat McDonald's Jack in the box or Wendy's are way better for you anyways 
The kids play area is dangerous big door kids can slam hands in it"
541714,"Golden coast II. ChinaCafe will just call you racist if you bitch about the order being wrong, then say call grubhub."
542788,"This establishment is downright racist.  We were told that we could sit in the booths and that it was first come first serve at the time.  Another couple proceeded to sit down at our booth and then we were told that we had to leave for no apparent reason.  The only different between us and them was race.  The bouncer then proceeded to scream at my friend that she needed to leave or he was going to make her leave.  All this was going on as the rude couple who took the table yelled and pointed middle fingers at us.  They were never asked to leave.  Very unfair, rude, racist treatment.  And actually before this event occurred I went to the bar to get a drink and was told by a bar tender that he was too busy to take my order and that I needed to find another bar tender.  Definitely the LAST time I will ever visit this establishment.  What a shame that people still get treated this way this day in age."
554719,"I wanted to give this McDonalds NO STARS, but I didn't know if I could.  Anyway, if you want your order WRONG, this is the place to be!! I have gone here on many occasions and out of 10 orders, 8 have been wrong. Be careful when Ordering a Sausage McMuffin, you will GET EGG PUT ON IT THERE.  I even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again WITH EGG, when I specifically said SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN!!!  I love all people and I am not racist but, if you gonna work in AMERICA you gotta not only SPEAK English, but UNDERSTAND it too!!!"
554936,Beware of this extremely racist place. If your not a local black person I guess  stay away.. This is my second & last time visit  this  F place... Food was dry had to send back ask for quarter chicken white instead they bring me out dark meet.. I told the waiters she just said ok.. Tip her $6 on $23 tap & got the heck out of there. Buyer be wear my stomach is upset I'm ready to go back down there & throw up in this place
555029,"TERRIBLE STAFF AND OWNERSHIP!!!! I work in hospitality and I've NEVER been treated so badly. These people have no clue how to treat their customers. I'm not racist by any means, but these people were Asian and just VERY rude!!! I don't recommend going there at all."
566391,"If I could give zero stars I certainly would.  I recently moved to the Phoenix area and rented a home from a private owner.  The property was managed by MEB rentals.  The entire paperwork process was a joke.  They demanded information from me that no company has ever requested.  Information the United States government never even requested when I joined the Marines.  They refused to honor a legal requirement by refusing to waive a security deposit for my Nationally recognized service dog.  I gave up the fight after a week because it was not worth the $250.  

Upon move in is when things got even worse.  When I had seen the property it had a beautiful green lawn.  When I arrived on move in day it was COMPLETELY DEAD.  They had shut the water off all month and had the let the grass go to hell.  Within the first week I had my sprinklers fixed, repairs to the garage door, and a  new water heater put in.  The fridge that was supplied does not make ice or dispense water.  Missing cabinet shelves ETC.

I had no keys to the mailbox and had to obtain them myself at a cost of $40.  I have been here a month and I still don't have a pool key.  Phoenix AZ in July with no pool key.  HORRIBLE!!!!!  Every time I call it takes them a few days to get back to me.  Every time I ask about something they pass the blame to another person or party.  

While I normally hate calling people out by name, I believe their incompetence in this situation warrants such personal recognition.  I have called the Manager Brandi Walsh no less then 10 times and have NEVER got a call back.  While her Co-Worker Kaitlin Beisgen ""occasionally"" calls back, it is never with good news and always seems to a burden for her to do so.    

If it wasn't so hot out I would consider living on the street under a freeway overpass. At least then I would not have to deal with the nonsense and unprofessional-ism that is MEB Rentals.  If you have other options, look into staying at a property run by ANY other company.  I would rather stay at a property run by the racist ***hole Donald Sterling then MEB Rentals."
582942,"Ate here for valentine's day with a prix fixe menu. WHAT A RIP OFF! $69/person + $20/person for wine pairings... Not including a 21% automatic gratuity for HORRIBLE SLUG-LIKE service!!! The waitress was super chatty and nosey when I was trying to have a romantic dinner with my girlfriend. The owner went to every table EXCEPT for ours to greet and make sure everyone was satisfied, although i did catch her looking at our table twice... Is everyone in arizona racist against Asians or something? 

Pot pie came out with FORKS instead of spoons.... huh?! The wrong second course was brought to our table... And we waited 20 minutes to have our water refilled. Seriously?!

Food: The owner should be embarrassed! The menu was entirely new with courses they've never tested out beforehand... And it all sucked!!!! Prawns and scallops were raw... At least sear the dang thing, the last time I checked I was at a French restaurant, not out having sushi. Oyster pot pie was disgusting... Might as well have gone to Marie calendar's for that. Petite filet was decently flavored, but a bit dry. Dessert was pathetic- you would THINK a nutella apricot upside down cake would be mouth wateringly delicious, but surprise!!!!!! It was a dry flippin cake with burnt nutella on top. Betty Crocker, please teach the chefs at Petite Maison a thing or two -_- 

I really wanted to try the infamous foie gras there since its been banned in california, but I'm so glad I didn't. It would've probably ruined my love for foie gras forever, just like this restaurant ruined what WAS a perfectly good valentine's day. 

Merci Petite Maison............... for the worst experience ever!"
582944,"My wife and I were at Petite Maison for Valentines and I am not sure what the previous poster was talking about.  Yeah, the service was a little slow, but the place was packed and who wants to be rushed through what is supposed to be a romantic dinner (well maybe if you are trying to break up or your date is boring . . .)

We live in NYC, eat at the finest restaurants in the world and are fierce critics of lousy food.  There were two choices for each of the four courses, and we ordered one of each, so we tasted literally everything on the menu that night.  We loved every bite.  Every dish was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented.

As far as the claim of racism, while I abhor the politics of Arizona, and would like to see Sheriff Joe Arpaio in jail, claiming that the staff of this place are racist is slanderous. I saw people of every different race and nationality enjoying their romantic dinners together, and there was absolutely no difference in how they were served.

Sounds like someone just had a bad date."
585624,"i feel kind of bad giving this joint a 2.star review because the service is actually really good.  i would give the service at least four stars, but the food isn't all that.  i don't like how all the food is served on disposable (environmentally unfriendly) plates with similarly environmentally unfriendly plastic utensils.  yeah, i don't like that.  the food itself is totally just so.so and has typically inflated aeroport prices.  the service is pretty nice though.  our cheerful and ""flamboyant"" waiter found a high chair for my son, and we appreciated that, especially since many of the other aeroport eateries don't have high chairs.  it's nice to see that, even though arizona is a racist state, there's at least enough openness that i'll see a not.necessarily.straight, chicano/latino working at a sports bar.  i mean, that's the norm where i'm from out here in the san francisco bay area; but... i know things can be different in arizona.

my wife ordered a crab louie salad.  it actually first arrived without any crab, but our waiter was cool about it and got the kitchen to fix that.  well, they weren't super generous with the crab, but it was definitely there.  my pulled pork sandwich was just so.so."
589288,"It was our favorite club before but last night the bartender is so rude. We had bought a lot of drinks and we tip really really good. But she seems to be so racist to Asian people. The last drinks that we ordered was from the other bartender. Because we stood at the bar for 20 minutes or longer but no one come to approach us. They were not busy during that time. The other bartender came only when we start waving our hands. And when she was getting our changes, she was whispering to the other ladies and let us wait there for 5 minutes looking at them whispering and laughing. It was a really bad night."
593830,"DON'T READ MY REVIEW IF..
1. You're not Filipino.
2. You're Filipino but you were raised in the US.
3. You haven't tried Jollibee in the Philippines before.

Seriously, this may sound racist but people who doesn't fall in these criteria understands.

I was born and raised in the PI and I grew up eating Jollibee on special occasions of my life (LOL). It is an acquired taste!!! You can't be craving fried chicken one day, come eat here and expect to have that American flavor to it. Same with Spaghetti. Filipino Spaghetti is sweet. Sometimes spicy. You can't expect it to taste Italian and be disappointed about it.

Their spaghetti is on point. Despite the fact that it only has 2 pieces of hotdog, or sausage (sometimes), it still tastes like home. I'm not a big ""chicken person"" so I can't really comment on the Chickenjoy. Their fries? It sucks. LOL Don't even think about it. Just pretend it's not on the menu. But my son loves their corn. It's just a little overpriced! I mean, you're better off buying a $1 can of Kernel and melt butter in it. 

But that's the point of coming here. Besides the ""hit-or-miss"" menu items, it's that ""I miss Philippines"" feeling. It's that ""teaching your kids their culture"", or that ""let's try something different"".

You honestly can't come here and expect a lot. Even the Jollibee's in the PI are not as it used to be when we were kids. Their servings are small and they only give you ONE packet of ketchup and ONE tissue to wipe with. LOL oh i know.."
595248,"For all of those who complain that they expect the food to be really good well lets start off with ""you get what you pay for""  I wouldn't say the food is great but its also not horrible.
Mon-fri 6.49 
Drink 1.50 free refills 
They also have pizza and salads...and ICE CREAM!!
I love egg rolls and I'm happy to say they didn't fail me here.
Also the wontons are super good 
The beef and broccoli is ok but the meat is to thick and broccoli...might as well throw in the whole bunch all together
The tofu is tasteless but at least they're giving people more options. 
They also have fish head (wtf) but its eatable and interesting..""don't see that at panda ex""
Servers here are a bit slow and can't really speak english..well it is a Chinese buffet ran by a Chinese family. Not being racist cuz I ask who the owner was.
Overall this place is good if on a budget or lunch for a group."
598025,the worst Chinese take out place ever i kinda saw it coming seeing how nasty they are at the kitchen the way they handle food is horrid they are dirty and there attitude makes it even worst i am from new york and know these type of Chinese people they racist and don't care as long as they get that money don't go here go to somewhere you know there good people these are bad people don't give them your hard earned money.
598256,"Modern Steak is probably not the type of place you want to go to if you're ""not white"".. my experience at this place was sooooo horrible that I would never come back. Not only were their food bad but they made us wait 40 mins (that was with reservation) and there was plenty of seats that were available, they told us that there was no waiter in those empty section but once we were sat down outside in the patio, we saw them filling those empty seating with white patrons. This place is so racist that I was surprise that they didn't ask us to leave from the back door. I can't believe there are still places like this!!!"
601504,"The first and last time I went, this place was crowded. It seemed a little out of date to me, and the people that were here didn't speak English and let their children run around barefoot while screaming. (Not trying to be racist at all, that kind of behavior is just annoying) Needless to say, I'm sure I can find a better place to do laundry until my landlord fixes my dryer."
613930,"I have been seeing Dominic for about three years.  He does a great job and I highly recommend him.

Reason I am giving one star is some of the staff and barbers here are clearly racist towards white people.  I have been patronized and harassed on several occasions as soon as I walk in the door.  

Needless to say my three years with No Grease has come to an end.  I will be taking my business elsewhere."
616939,"This is the most racist hotel I have ever been to in my life.  I asked an employee, Frankie Hughes, for help with the bill that I received and was called a dumb*** n-word.  I can't believe that someone like this works in the customer service field.  This type of behavior was totally uncalled for by anyone.  I travel for work all the time and will NEVER use this hotel or any of their brands again!!"
616955,"I love this Goodwill. The clothes, shoes, and linens are sold by the pound and everything else is half off.  That said the employees who move the carts are rude and yell at you if you dont obey the unposted rules... so here they are... stay behind the blue line when they're moving in or out carts, dont touch the new cart until they tell you too, keep your kids with you at all times, and pay for the big ticketed merchandise immediately (remove tag from item, go to register, check out, remove it from store). If you break the rules or just dont know them be prepared to be yelled at, glared at, or dismissed from the store. Other than the cart moving employees, be prepared to be thoroughly annoyed by the resellers and (not to be racist or un-p.c.) the hispanics. Both will have multiple carts, block aisles, grab your merchandise, and steal your buggy (not all do this but enough do it that its an issue). 

Those issues aside you can find a lot of great things here.  I found a 3 pc Ralph Lauren shirt, blouse, and cardigan set here. There's a lot of name brand items and sizes from the smallest of smalls to 4x and more. There's a lot of books and some furniture."
624983,So i loved coming here and relaxing and enjoying a drink or two with my bf and service seemed decent. So i had a surprise bday about a mos ago and there were about 4 couples who came and sat at their largest table which fit 12-14 people. Well everyone was excited giving me hugs and my surprise of them being there for my birthday. One of the couples had brought in two cups of their own and within 10 min of being there a lady came up and was very blunt and rude and took them from our table. I watched her dump out the cups and almost throw them away but decided to give them back and rudely set them on the table and walked away without an explanation. We all sat in awe. So we waited awhile for our  food and a waitress comes up and tells us to be quiet. Wowww! There was a full room of people and a table of 5 African americans that were just as loud but they chose to come to our table instead (kind of racist we thought & appalled) and music was  blaring. If they make large tables for that many people expect it to be loud. So i went to complain to a manager and the lady behind the bar who was rude and took our cups ended up being the 'manager'. I proceeded to complain and say she was rude & the 'manager' smirks at me multiple times instead of apologizing & 2 women at the bar jump in and defend her by saying  shes not.  The two women ended up being employees that were drinking after shift which didnt help the situation. We left very unhappy!! Im soo appalled with this place!! We all will never be back which everyone who came were all first time visitors. Quite embarrassing for my bf who set the surprise up.  :(
628869,"This place does not even deserve a single star after the terrible experiences I have had here. Security is rude, door staff are rude and the club is not even worth it. I have had several inappropriate incidents there that I've never experienced with any of the other Scottsdale clubs. I do not recommend this racist and over priced club."
632653,"While my visit to this Dollar Tree on Peoria Avenue in Phoenix Arizona off of I 17 and 28th Drive. Was the most rude and disgusting behavior from a manager that was so racist and so profoundly loud yelling at one of the employees which happens to be an African American young boy. It was so loud the whole store got quiet. Korina the manager was screaming at him because he called for backup. It's the worst thing I've witnessed. While I was asking one of the other employees for a district managers number all of a sudden Karina popped up. She said there is no district managers number they can give me and gave me corporates number and was very rude and disgusting again. Got him off the register, I witnessed all the  cacusation females laughing about the situation this is total racist and discrimination which happens to be strictly employed by Caucasian. #Racist #Discrimination #Managerisabitch #Dollartree"
638096,"I just went in to this tattoo shop because I read that  they got good reviews on yelp. Well, it was a big disappointment . The girl I spoke to, platinum blonde short hair was very rude. She made it so difficult for me to get and see anyone. I don't know if because I'm Asian and I'm not good enough to be in there and get a service from them. I feel like I'm being judge and got treated by my skin color and my face. This is very bad business on their part and I will not recommend anyone  to go there. How can she treat you any different if she's being racist and judge up upon on how you look??? I don't think this place even deserve a star because of their horrible customer service.

Oh btw, her name is Heather and when I  called back to ask for her name AND she hung up after I ask if I was talking to her. I've tried two call back several more times and the phone was just ringing.  They close at 5pm and I called at 4:15pm."
642022,"I have been going to Aloha Kitchen for about 3 years now, and have always had great food and great service.  Their lumpia are awesome, all nice and crispy, and the pork shu mai are little dumplings from heaven, but sadly they stopped serving them at the Henderson location.  Pork Adobo may be one of my all-time favorite things to eat, and Aloha's is spot-on, so moist and tender!  The Kalua pig is fantastic, and so is the garlic chicken. The katsu is never greasy, and they don't skimp on the sauces. If you don't like mac salad don't worry, you can have kimchee instead! I actually used to go to L&L all the time, until a racist person working behind the counter discriminated against me because of the color of my skin, so I refuse to frequent their business again.  So I am glad I turned to Aloha Kitchen. The staff at Aloha is always nice and cheerful, and they actually bring you out your food!  I'm moving to Florida in June, and am definitely going to miss this place...:( If you like your Hawaiian food with more of a Filipino flair, and great service, then Aloha Kitchen is the place for you!  Mahalo!"
645242,"so i had a fairly foul experience here.  i'm trying to get my TV professionally packed and shipped out to boston.  i go to another place to get the box, and go to UPS to ask them how much it would be to pack the tv properly if i already have the box, the young black (sorry for the somewhat stereotypical and borderline racist description but i didn't catch his name) employee working behind the desk proceeded to quote me 8-16 dollars to pack it.  I was pretty ecstatic, being that the place where i bought the box quoted me at like 60 dollars starting to pack it.  so i ask him, definitely 16 dollars at most?  great, i'll go get the TV, can you guys do it today?  ""sounds like a plan"" he responds, and all the way back home i go to get my TV.  Get the TV, lug it back to UPS, i see the same guy again and he cheerfully welcomes me and invites me to set the TV down on the counter.  he runs into the back, and i hear him say to a colleague, ""hey can you come out and help me pack this?""  then out from the back comes this dinosaur of an old man who probably packed noah's ark back in the day (why in the world UPS employees people who are over 2000 years old who can barely life a sheet of paper is beyond me) walks up to me and says, ""60 dollars JUST for packing.""  and i say, excuse me?  60, as in six zero?  your employee here just told me it would at most be 16 dollars?  The young dude I had been dealing with then proceeds to say, that's not what the chart says over there?  i went off of that...the dinosaur responds, ""no there's a SPECIAL one for TVs, this will be $60.""

young black dude, if you by chance come across this, you did no wrong.  i was happy with your service albeit being inconvenienced and misinformed.  but tell your fossil of a boss to learn some fucking customer service.  if one thing is promised, it better pull thru.  you guys need to eat the cost if that's the case.  lugging around a TV all over town with a set expectation, and then not following thru is not my idea of a good use of time.  

all in all, don't go here.  the old ass people working here are rude as shit, and don't back their other employees.  to be quite honest, i've had only mediocre experiences with UPS as a whole to date, i think my money will be going to fedex and box bros from here on out."
645560,Avoid this racist place! My wife wanted a $900 ring but the idiot working the jewelry counter was more interested in serving black people that came in way after we came on. Their loss ...
651740,"GREAT PLACE!!! Hands down best Dominican salon I've been to in a really long time. The salon was clean, spacious and well taken care of.  

I am a black Latina and was treated with nothing but respect from the time I entered the door. The stylists were very polite and chatty and I didn't get a racist vibe from either of them so I have no idea what those reviews were talking about. In fact, I have thin and damaged hair and am very used to stylist lecturing me about my sad hair but I didn't hear a peep from either of them. 

The owner's name is Eddi and she's very nice and knows a lot about hair. She was fast and knew what my hair needed as soon as I walked in. 

The stylist who washed my hair did a great job, three shampoos and deep conditioner and she used Authentic Dominican products that smelled amazing and they sell the same products in the salon. I will definitely come back and am disappointed that I almost didn't stop in because of the reviews about racist treatment. In the end my hair was clean, smelled great and had the necessary volume needed to stand the Las Vegas sun."
652999,"Before I take a hike from Yelp, I really want to give credit to the hard working employees at this location. I usually don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but I don't know a group of guys who treat me better. 

I've probably eaten here over 100 times this year. The food is really good and the service is outstanding. I actually think this place is pretty close to authentic because they don't use ground beef in their tacos. 

9 out of 10 times I come here after midnight. On weekend nights, you get a lot of drunk girls in club dresses who are coming home from a night of drunken stupidity(I am hardcore straight-edge, so yes I believe people who drink alcohol are pathetic...and yes I'm talking to you reading this), and some will say racist remarks towards Mexican people. I can't count how many times I've had to sit here and listen to that. The Mexican-American workers here have a lot patience having to deal with that. I always tip them extra for having to endure that crap.

9 out of 10 time I get the Al-Pastor fries!! It's a part of the secret menu so you won't find it on the board. They get french fries and put salsa, beans, sour cream, guacamole, and tons of Al Pastor on it. They also got 99 cent Taco Wednesday!!! 

The guys work really hard here, especially Arturo. They keep it spotless and clean. The salsa bar is really upscale compared to other Mexican restaurants!  

Actually, I did review this place back in January of 2012, but the yelp filter kept eating my review...apparently the filter thinks I work here. Let me just say that the Yelp filter is a complete dumbsh!t because I don't work at ROBERTO'S TACO SHOP, I work at Burger King off of Martin Luther King and Eastern. If you don't believe me, ask Yelp Elite Jen G. She just happens to be assistant manager."
653375,"Is the elder waitress racist or something? I hate to label people. But that was the experience I got. I went to the restaurant for breakfast. Was the only non-white. For a long time I didn't get a menu. I had to ask for it. While I observed the white customers after me got menu immediately. When the waitress went around asking refills on coffee, she just skipped right past me. In the end when I stepped out and said bye, she just stared at me. Ok for food, bad for service."
653792,"Best Robertos I've ever been to in Las Vegas. Very clean, cool retro look, nice staff who actually speaks and understands English very fluently. Other Robertos I've been too in Vegas was dirty, building looked rundown and old, and the people who worked their could barely even speak English. I am not being racist or want to be perceived as being a racist but I am just stating facts.

Anyways, the food is always great and on point at this location. I visit this Robertos about 3-4 times a week to grab breakfast or dinner. The bacon, eggs, and potatoes breakfast burritos are amazing and very filling. And they're all under $5 for 1/2 lb chunk burrito. 

For dinner you can't go wrong with the Carne Asda fries or anchors or the rolled toquitos. Your choice of beef or chicken. Condiments such as cucumbers, limes, and sauces are always fresh and the area is always clean unlike other Robertos in this town.

Some of the specials they have to offer is wet bean and cheese burrito Mondays for $3.99, Chicken burrito Tuesdays for $3.99 (Mon. & Tues. offers come with a drink and a side of beans and rice), and 99 cent taco Wednesdays.

I don't have any complaints."
667572,"On their website, The Duce advertises themselves as ""Where pretty meets gritty and produce meets prohibition.""  They say you can plan an unforgettable event at The Duce.  Well, I definitely had an unforgettable experience...

They pose the question, ""What the Duce!?""  Don't worry, they answer it:

""What the duce?...it is what it was ... a 1928 warehouse that once anchored a bustling produce district by day... the notorious deuce by night... dice, vice, jazz and other not so good clean fun.
Same corner... about a century later...prohibition meets produce ...again... and we're tippin' our hats to both!""

-Steve & Andi, the duce cofounders



Last night, they didn't tip their hats to both--At least not in our direction.  No, we were met with a bigoted owner who shut down our show before it even began.  Worse, he allowed our event to set up; waited for our event patrons to buy food and drinks; and then he pulled the plug on our show.

His claim: They are a family friendly establishment.  Our music and T-Shirts (which had the event name on them) are not.

...so our event was canceled right before its start time.  Again we didn't begin, offend someone, and then this decision was made.  It was made while customers sat around fellowshipping with one another, waiting for the show to start.

The event, an open mic poetry show.  The premise being a play on a well known skit from comedian, Dave Chappelle.  We wanted a space where we could have forthright, candid speech.  That freedom of speech was derailed because of the prejudice beliefs of The Duce.  It was curtailed because they acted on the weakness of rationalizing stereotypes.  They saw too many black and brown faces listening to culturally appropriate music, and their LACK OF cultural knowledge enabled them to make an assumption about our party.  They reduced us to offensive thugs.  They deduced were no good.  They could lose business over us, the poets.

It was appalling.  I've never been to a show that was called to a halt for peacefully gathering-- for laughing and smiling.  Of all I've committed to, this was the show I've been highly anticipating.  It was a bit of a reunion show for many of us.  Like most adults of a certain age, our careers and family create responsibilities that don't allow most of us to get out often anymore. We're not the young adults we used to be.  In addition, I relocated to another state and haven't seen those beautiful faces in awhile.  This show was the dream of a good friend of mine.  It was one he'd wanted to throw for years.  I didn't just fly in as the featured guest.  I came to support a person who is dear to me.  I came to see and be a part of the culmination of years of planning.


The Duce crushed that.  I wish I could fulfill some stereotype so that other bigots reading this can justify the owners cold decision.  I wish I could paint some gangster scene for you but I can't.  That wasn't our group, and I'd be lying if I made us scary, shifty, boisterous people.  The Duce made that deduction however.  They demonized us as a group.  There are too many great mothers and fathers in ""our community"" of artists to not be family oriented and mindful.  If only there were families there that night, we could've proved it.  However, there was only the mature adults in our crowd and the mature adults on the other side of the venue.

The Duce (self proclaimed lovers of gritty, notorious deuce by night... dice, vice, jazz and other not so good clean fun) enjoys events with the Mick Jaggers, the Ozzy Osbornes, and the Stevie Nicks.  They don't mind white ""family friendly"" bands whose members and fans pop pills; snort lines of coke; take mushrooms; trip on acid; ingest Molly; and become oversexed on ecstasy.  They don't appreciate the humor of the Dave Chapelles, Richard Pryors, or Kevin Harts.  They don't feel positive inspiration from the James Baldwins,  Maya Angelous, Nikki Giovannis, or Langston Hughes.  No Martin or Malcolms for them.

I will never patron this place again.  I should've known what to expect after viewing the photos on their website and seeing a marked lack of diversity that we would be singled out and ostracized.  I should've known after viewin their Facebook page and noticing how often they're hiring for (basically) all positions regularly something was fishy.  If you can't keep your employees happy where you're constantly needing to re-hire everything but the kitchen sink... Something is wrong.

The Duce, the Douche.  A racist establishment by any name is still an ugly blight to be avoided."
668347,"This ride has a descent that feels (and is, of course) too slow to me virtually the whole way down that it is much more relaxing than it is thrilling. It is pretty much a vertical zip line, except personally, I find the horizontal ziplines to feel more thrilling. Do it if you're trying to nudge yourself into bigger, faster thrills and are pretty new to the thrill world.
OR do it if you are an experienced thrill-seeker (who doesn't fool themselves but know that they are actually an EXPERIENCED THRILL-seeker)  who has expectations that this may be much slower than their liking or too tamed but still want to do it for other reasons than a thrill. For me,  I don't think it would be worth even a quarter of what they charged ($109.99) to do a second time... maybe like 15-20 bucks tops. 

I didn't even purchase a wrist camera or photos because I had a huge feeling from experience with other thrill rides that this was going to be more about anticipation, huge reliance on the world-record breaking height for a SkyJump, and hype than actual thrill.  Needless to say, I was right. I don't need to pay the extra money to commemorate something that's not really anything to write home about with high marks. My SO said that I looked like a ragdoll coming down because I was so limp, and there was a reason for that. It was a relaxing experience though and something like a spa treatment for your mind, I guess.

I did the jump several minutes past midnight in late March, so the view was filled with bright orange lights and you could still make out things really well. I enjoyed the cool breeze and being in the cool, mild darkness above lights the most about the ride. 

The staff were great in terms of their service to me; one of the male staff at the top kept striking friendly conversation with me while being thoroughly professional and the girl who suited me up was very attentive to everything. However, I found the Asian male staffer who kept making stupid racist jokes in a rowdy manner among his co-workers and other customers to be so obnoxious that he detracted from the atmosphere. I'm not taking any stars off because of this though.

Oh, and to anyone who reads the review of RIC A., who says that this is ""very similar to those rides you see at fairs & other amusement parks; where they hoise you to the top, release you & you swing back and forth,"" THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT. He describes some of the major differences already, so I don't why he says it's ""very similiar.""  What he is describing is a skycoaster by the way. 
HERE's THE TRUTH: the SkyJump is a controlled descent that decelerates to a stop, with an ascent that takes place on a fast elevator of the building, and it stops at the end of the vertical controlled fall. A skycoaster is complete free fall (like that of a bungee jump) with large swings back and forth to a stop, and the ascent is when they hoist you [slowly] to the top. As an extra bit, you then have to pull on a rip cord attached to your harness to release yourself into that free fall as opposed to jumping off. They're very, very different rides. 
In fact there's more similarity between base jumping and the SkyJump (which are still quite different) than there is between a skycoaster and the SkyJump. 

I just don't want anyone to be badly misinformed."
671111,Went in for breakfast.  Chicken fried steak and eggs- reminds me of my great grandfather's cooking.  Staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  The waitress outfits   Are a plus also.  Will definitely be back.  And the owner is not a racist as said in a previous review-just believes in the Constitution and the conservative ideas that helped create our nation's charter.
691018,Horrible experience !!!charles the manager did not make me feel welcome after the fourth straight night here ! He was honestly disrespect and very racist ! Never ever coming to this place! Four straight nights of coming to this place and experiencing such disrespect from the waiter and manager was unprofessional. If you ever decide to come here stay away from Charles ! He should not be working here
692088,"Dillon's is a great place to go that is close to my house and has really good baby back ribs.  The service here has always been good to us.

We now know never to come there on a Wednesday night....We recently came to dinner on a Wednesday night with our 3-YO son and they seated us in the ""bar"" area since the rest of the restaurant was completely empty.  It was comedy night.  Lets just say we couldn't eat our food fast enough before ALL 4 of the ""comedians"" spouted out just about every cuss word you could imagine on top of making disgusting sexual and racist jokes.  The sad part is that the crowd also seemed a bit put off, as no one laughed.  Even the comedians said we were a tough crowd.  If I had ear muffs, they would've been around my sons ears.  I'm surprised that the server didn't seat us in the other room or at least warn us that the comedians used this kind of language.  And it's not the 1st time either since we told our friends about it and they said it was the same thing the week before when they were there.  I ended up not even finishing my dinner and spent a lot of the time letting him play outside while my husband finished his dinner.

Aside from that bad experience, we just know not to come on that night anymore.  Other than that, their mac n' cheese is really good, baby back ribs are good and their bbq beans are a hit."
692448,"My best friend came to visit from Mexico, and wanted to go out. A couple of friends said that a band was going to play at Whiskey River so we decided to head over there. there was a line and we only waited around 15 mins to get in.  The man at the door checked our id's and my friend presented his Mexican Passport to prove age. This bouncer, started going through the passport  pages and I told him the age was in main page of the passport. He said he needed to find the ""Visa"" to let him in because he wasn't a US Citizen.  This upset me because it is none of his business to look for the visa stamp, I can understand if it is and police officer, TSA, government official, but not this ""bouncer"" who gets paid to check ages.  Very unprofessional and just plain racist from his part. 

After finally going in, the music was good and the band was great! until someone vomited in the middle of the dance floor (not the place's fault). it was cleaned right away. Drink prices were reasonable and the place is big. 

But the bouncer ruined our experience and I will not be back to Whiskey River. 

Incident happened 01/16/2011 around 11pm."
704970,"Previous reviewer chimed in about some racist incident they had here...which initially put me on edge. 

However after going for a brunch on 8-19-15 I must say that my fears were dispelled completely. 

I did however notice that the greeter at the door was a little sour in the attitude dept. However no one else was. The waiter was one of the best I've seen in Charlotte. His attentiveness and service to my  family was beyond reproach.

If there's one place you want to eat in Charlotte....THIS IS IT folks. I had an amazing cup of coffee.Just perfectly fruity tones as coffee flavors go. 
My french toast was sooooo good. I know a few NYC bakers who'd kill for the recipe of that perfectly decadent soft textured loaf of heavenly bread. I also had a side of corn beef hash that was crisped perfectly on one side. That little crisp flair on the corn beef hash is indicative of a quality eatery in my opinion. Their big fluffy  biscuits were above average also.  I so badly wanted to order their fried chicken but was unfortunately deterred by the promise of some mythical Chicken Coop joint fairly nearby. What a mistake that was. Next time I'll get it from Midnight Diner. 

Just a flawless dining experience. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did."
706547,"Security guard has something against teenage skaters. 
The majority of whom were Latino and she told them at the top of her lungs ""go to Taco Bell if you want"" while pushing them out the door. 

She let everyone know exactly what she thought of them too. Shouting, instead of talking to customers or other staff ""you know skaters"" hardy har har. 

I know they probably did bug her at some point, but my God they are kids, they bug everyone, you just get on with it?

She was unprofessional and let everyone know it, and not to mention racist with a remark like ""go to Taco Bell if you want"" to a bunch of Latino teenagers. 

I know MacDonald's isn't an ""outstanding"" place to eat. But shut up and let me get on with it without listening to you shout at a bunch of bored teenagers. 

The food is what it is lol"
717420,"Three words: Ding Dong Burger. One of the best things about Pinky's is the opportunity to order a 5 oz burger a la carte for under $5. The Ding Dong Burger is by far the best of the lot: slathered with peanut butter, honey cilantro slaw, and Sriracha, it is a wonderful expression of Asian-inspired flavor. 

You may ask yourself, ""That title, though... am I eating a racist burger?"" The answer, as it turns out, is no: http://www.thai-language.com/forums/t/translation/basic/t7168

Anyway, Pinky's is a gem of a place. Divey, cheap, fun, and delicious. The beer and drink specials will treat your wallet with kid gloves while the food, most of it heavily fried, will make your waistline expand. But, the flavors are worth it, goddammit. They have these awesome crab hush puppies of which you can't just eat one. They serve delicious local dishes, like fried squash and fried pickles. They have some awesome all-beef hot dogs. They feature a variety of local beers for next to no money. 

AND! They're open till 11 pm on a Sunday! Perfect for late eaters like me."
723392,"honestly never felt so offended in my life. took us about 10 minutes to get acknowledged for our drink order and 20 minutes after that to even get acknowledge to ask for our check. I don't know if the guy was racist or something, but I left there feeling like shit.

but James is awesome though! if you go, go for him!"
723495,"Racist...3 times I have ordered in the last year and three 3 times they lose it...but when my native spanish speaking friends order, red carpet...  hmmmm....racist as hell.   Until I start speaking spanish....yes I am cuban, then I get the service....but only after they realize this.....racist racist racist."
729090,"So... I tried out Savoy for happy hour and apps this past Friday night and I found it very pleasant. They have tried hard with the decor and an outside roof patio lounge area. Happy hour specials are decent. It is comfortable with plenty of seating.

At first I was scared off that the prices would be sky high, because of the atmosphere, they were not. Appetizers started at 6$ drinks at 6$ for happy hour. Fancy martinis can climb to 10$ and up after that though. 

I tried the trio platter with crab cake arugula salad and fried veggie pasty thing, it was nice. My friend tried the Tilapia fish tacos. The rest of the menu is mostly meat dishes, seafood platters, steaks, and lamb chops. Price climbs but it is not outrageous. It is not a place for vegetarians and vegans, one jerk on yelp gave them a one star review for this. Um if you don't eat a certain kind of food you should probably google their menu before you eat there its common sense. 

My friend tried the Tilapia fish tacos and liked hers. Drinks and service were fine we had no problems with rude or unfriendly staff, I wish there was music. There was some but it was very quiet. There is only one stall in the bathroom, I don't mind waiting because it is a nice bathroom modern and clean but its worth noting just in case. 

Also I wish the menu had more variety it was nice but Its like walking into any other big new thing in Pittsburgh and seeing the exact same food over and over again, Can I get a fish taco with maybe a chipotle salmon in it instead of freakin tilapia everywhere I go? But I digress this is a nice place and definitely suffices for a nice night on town. There is also plenty of comfy seating if it is not packed.

I have to say if you're from another city with a more diverse viewpoint on life (or you have a life at all) do not read the one star blatant racist reviews of this place on yelp. It's getting old already Pittsburgh give it up its 2013, grow up already. Get off your stupid little hill and accept that there are several types of people in the world doing their own thing and that thing might be new to you but that's not a good reason to put it down and spew your stupidity all over yelp. Sometimes I wish I could thumbs down other peoples reviews. Ok rant over"
743790,"Perfect hotel for Phoenix they are as  racist as Arizona is .
Good job Westin keeping it real for AZ  .. 
You should change your publicity  only white people allow .."
756452,"We will never go to this racist place again. My husband along with my son waited for over 10  minutes for someone to serve us, no one ever stopped by to even greet us. They weren't even busy, I watched a few tables get sat after us and the servers didn't waste any time going to greet them and taking their drink order. One server walked by us twice and looked at us without saying a word and she wasn't busy bc she was standing around talking to other servers who were waiting for tables. I'm sure if we weren't black they would have greeted us with a smile, but we decided to get up and leave and spend our money elsewhere. I just moved to Charlotte and clearly I don't know the rules about the white and black sides of town and clearly this is for the white people!"
770052,"I thought I would try some place new, I really dislike judgmental ppl and clearly that's what these ppl are, they were very rude , did the job very bad, and I don't know if they were racist because they think Mexicans don't tip but clearly I always do , but please DO NOT GO HERE! Worst place ever!"
770695,"I have shopped here numerous times over the years. I have always loved their selection of kids' wear. Great brands, especially for little boys. They have great sales and a friendly staff. I was SUPER disappointed when I visited last week and found several kids shirts with really racist Native American imagery. It's not ok to sell tshirts with war bonnets on skulls and the like (there were 3 different shirts with various appropriated images, that is just one of them). I let the girl that was there know at the time and I hope they remove the shirts and stop carrying things like that. This is 2014, they should know better. I won't be spending my money there until they fix their purchasing."
787329,"My 15 year old cousin was visiting from Utah and I decided to take her here to do something fun together and to try the place out. She had the acrylic full set done and I had a pedi. We also had coupons but ended up paying more because they said they had used a more expensive polish after the fact, which we were never asked for, but ended up paying for it. I thought it was rude, but paid anyway. Two days later my cousins nails changed to a yellowish color and the nails were chipping on the edges. We went back to the salon to get them re-done, with an open mind and not aggressive at all. From the moment the older lady working there saw her nails (we think the owner), she started scolding us very defensively saying that it wasn't the salon's fault or her products that it must be something my cousin was eating or her make up. The reaction and comments that we received was/were extremely racist saying that ""you Mexican's like to eat tamales and that's what happen"", ""all the spicy food"" and also accused my cousin of being a liar.  I'm not a confrontational person and avoid being disrespectful. I immediately told her that she was also a minority and she shouldn't say racist things and to treat people, specially her customers the way she would like to be treated. My cousin explained to her that she gets them done all the time and  this problem has never happen before.  While we were there another young girl came in asking to get her nails fixed for the same problem. I will diffidently not come back and I suggest everyone to avoid this place. There are plenty of great salons with professional technicians that would appreciate the business."
787363,"There is a Grand Cafe at every single Station Casino property besides for Aliante. Personally, I only come to Grand Cafes after midnight for the Graveyard special. But, unfortunately not all Grand Cafe's are born equally.  

This location at Texas Station is light years ahead of the Santa Fe and the Red Rock location. 

The service is extremely quick. Unlike the Red Rock, this place will actually tell you ""I'll be right with you"" instead of just pretending to ignore you. 

The server comes within 2-3 minutes after the host seats you. At Red Rock and Santa Fe, the server may take up to 30 minutes.
 
The servers here at Texas Station won't make excuses. At Red Rock and Santa Fe, the servers absolutely can't stop making excuses. It's always ""I'm just so busy!"" or ""No one told me that I was supposed to be your server!"". 

Unlike at Red Rock, you won't get seated near  drunk douchebags in club clothing, who are screaming profanity and racist remarks. You don't get that annoying bitter Summerlin/North West crowd that complains and fights over every little thing. The customers here at Texas are more of a blue collared working class type, who enjoy a quiet environment when they eat.

The food here is much better. At Red Rock, a huge part of the steak is that rubbery fatty substance that is inedible. The steak here at Texas is all meat and much more tender. You don't have to work your ass off to eat it!

I find it odd how Summerlin and NW people always talk sh!t on North Las Vegas residents. They always say that NLV people are: ""poor"", ""criminals"", ""low lives"". But, when you actually come to a NLV casino, the service and quality is far superior to a Summerlin casino. I hate how at Summerlin casinos, the workers always b!tch about how they hate their jobs and how: ""he only tipped me 2 dollars"". Gimme a break,  if my Graveyard special meal only cost $4.99, I ain't gonna f*cking leave a tip that is more than the price of the f*cking meal. Be happy I even leave 50 cents.    

I would rather drive the extra distance to come here. The service is very friendly, and the food tastes way better."
796243,"I am still shell shocked from my extremely poor and disgraceful experience here.  First I was overcharged for my to go order when I picked up some food. The polite lady fixed it. Then I got home and found out that they gave me meat pies and not cheese. I have stopped eating meat, so was not exactly happy when I bite into a pastry filled with frozen meat.  When I called the manager, he said I could come back and pick up the cheese pies. I was not going to go back uptown. I asked him to deliver them and he said no, he was short staffed. I requested a refund and he said, he can't do that over the phone.

The next day I had to go in (out of my way) to get a $10 refund. I explained to the manager that I was not happy with the customer service. He said, ""you don't believe in mistakes?"" I said yes of course, but I believe in good customer service to redeem it. I didn't get what I ordered and was inconvenienced to come back in to get a refund. 

The manager said, ""where are you from?"" WHAT does ethnicity matter??? To my surprise, he said... yes YOU PEOPLE LIKE TO COMPLAIN. OMG. I told him that is racist!! He said he did not care. I said, I was brought up in the USA and my ethnicity does not matter. He repeated, yes you ppl like to complain. YOU PEOPLE!?!?  I told him I am not happy with the customer service, and I will write a review. After saying that, he stopped and said now I am not giving you a refund at all. 

I cannot believe that this overpriced place is letting such an ignorant racist person run the restaurant. 

Overall the quality of the food is pre-prepared, extremely overpriced and now disgusting customer service.

Follow my other reviews for quality Mediterranean food in Charlotte.   There is a reason this restaurant is always empty."
798181,"Until last month I had nothing but good things to say about this place. I mean who wouldnt like a theater where they have a menu where you can order while you watch the movie, waiters, alcholic beverages and they bring the popcorn to you! But an incident happened that has me never wanting to go there again. I was there with my girl, girl's sister and my girl's son when all of a sudden a worker comes and accuses us of having a dog with us and said that we needed to put the dog in the car. We told the guy who claimed he was the manager that he could search us and the area we are sitting in, which he did and didnt find any dog but he still insisted that we had one because a worker of his had supposedly seen one. It seems like this area is racist because we were the only ones in the theater who were not caucasian and they just simply made something up to get us out of there. They refused to give us a refund and kicked us out for something that wasnt even true. Dont waste your time at this unprofessional and potentially racist establishment. Never have i had such a horrible experience at a theater before."
800282,"No good, this post office has a racist employee, with a really bad attitude, the other 2 employees r fine, but for some reason, almost every time i end up going and wait in line, this is the guy I end up facing, I will try to catch this guys name next time and update my post. I plan to notify and file a complaint with usps on there website too."
801136,"We've eaten at Chipotle several times before, but never at this location. And never again at this location. The entree items we got were just fine. The chips were cold, but that is far from the problem. 

The issue was the 20-something man who appeared to be the shift manager. First, he was wearing Man-dex. Yes, that's what I said. Spandex. And they were cropped to boot. Somehow, I don't think they were a uniform option. Then, as he weirdly danced around the dining area, doing what, I don't know (certainly not wiping off the filthy tables), a vision came to me of Jame Gumb. I'll give you all a minute to shudder. Then there was also the patronizing and borderline racist interactions with his largely Hispanic staff. He loudly announced to us that he had just learned the Spanish word for ""turkey."" Then he turned to the man making our food, said the word, and then made a turkey sound. Yes, he gobble-gobbled at the poor man. He did this again and again. It was clear that the staff was embarrassed. 

My husband and I were flabbergasted. It was hard not to stare at him in awe of his assholery. Was he high? Could be. Was he a loser who had no business being in charge of a store? Most definitely. 

Chipotle, call us when you've replaced this jerk."
814049,"Terrible service! Almost received no fish in my ""fish tacos""!? I asked for it to be fixed which she did with a nice attitude. SMH! 



Also for some reason it's ok to use faul language!? A few guys kept using the word ""PUSSY""? If it were me id be called CREEPY and escorted out the restaurant. They also felt it was ok to talk about black people in light of all the negative things happening now. I'LL never attended this racist establishment ever again. I was a regular from Vegas to Phoenix. NEVER AGAIN!"

828479,"Well... I should of read these reviews first before even thinking of going to this place... I saw an add on Craigslist and it said $29.99 ON ALL DOGS UNDER 20lbs and thought what the heck I'll try them out. I get there and being the first time of taking my dog to a groomer I was expecting some sort of professional service but I was dead wrong... I called 2 hrs before to see if they would take walkins n they said yes so I got my kids ready and left to the pet salon. There was a kid (about 18) I think he was getting trained, and there was a guy, some fat guy. I told him I was there to get the Craigslist special and they said yes but that is only for dogs 15lbs and under when I told him the add said 20lbs get said no its 15lbs and under. I don't like so I said OK latest, he turned and said your dog is too big (a 19lbs terrier) if you want to I can do it for 35 but it will be till tomorrow, I said no and left. I went to PETCO n the lady there was very nice so we just paid $35 and sent him an email asking him to change his add on Craigslist n this is what his customer service came to:

* CRAIGSLIST ADVISORY --- AVOID SCAMS BY DEALING LOCALLY **Avoid: wiring money, cross-border deals, work-at-home ** Beware: cashier checks, money orders, escrow, shipping ** More Info: http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams  http://lasvegas.craigslist.org/pet/3142764986.html 

 Change your add since it clearly states $29.99 on all dogs under 20lbs and you told me it was only for under 15lbs... you should of just told me you didn't want to give us service and it was cool, you didn't have to lie your way out of my money... but its OK I'm never going back there again.

His response:
Thank you for never coming over to my shop n tell me were are you gonna get your dog groomed for 35 in the shape you brought it over? This add I dint post I have to look into it onestly if I new I made a mistake I woul defently repair but with over 15 years on the bussines I canot run a business advertising one thing and sayin other that would not be profetional, I dint say lie cuz I dint want your money bro next time when goin yo other businesd wait to see wut they have to offer insted of jumping to conclution cuz the way you reacted about me saying it would be more looks its notokay because 35 dollars for a full service groomed in the codition you brought him in its NOT BAD AT ALL Sent from my Cricket smartphone

My reply:
Jajaja its OK PETCO just gave me the full service for $35... I didn't mind paying $45 even I know what the condition of my dog was... I just hate liars...

His reply:
Thats a lie petco charges 46 for now whos the lier but enough of this im so happy your not coming here your a chip mexican just like all the hispanincs this is not a fhis market were you can bargin the price im glad your at petco im glad I dint groome your dog I feel bad for him if I wad your dog I rather b put to sleep the to b own by you


My last reply:
Jajsja this will go on one of your reviews thanks... and yes PETCO charges $46 but I got a discount jajja


Now just let me know how is it that being this racist will keep him in business. I was not cheap bargaining but at least be honest that you made a mistake.. but calling me a  chip (I think he meant cheap) Mexican is not the way to do business."
834722,"Just moved to Phoenix from Denver and Planet of the Drums was our first show experience in the area. Drums killed it, but the venue was a bummer. 

Let's start with THE LINE. We purchased our tix in adv and waited in line close to 40 minutes - the line stretched more than a block. And yet, when I went up front to investigate the bouncer was not admitting anyone. He was holding the gate. When we asked if the show was oversold he asked if we had tix and when we said yes, ""Then not for you."" So not only were they using up our precious party time, they were being jerks about it. Note to self: if I ever come here again, arrive super early.

And first thing, I used THE RESTROOM. Don't get me wrong - venues are dirty places, but I'm talking beginning of the night and the floor was already super sticky.

And then we got past that BIG RAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE VENUE. Over 21ers have to consume all alcohol before being able to use the restroom or get to the patio. It felt like a disservice to those people paying forthose OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED DRINKS. I was thinking, maybe it's just this show, but it's mentioned in multiple reviews. Is this an AZ thing? When you have an 18+ crowd, there has to be a partition? 

The under 21 side was not full by any means, though. We ended up going over there to escape the heat/crowd on the other side. 

There were a few things they did right. Kudos to the bar staff for being quick, and security was quick to respond to our request for help when a racist jerk in the crowd started bugging us...

Overall, though, there are a lot of areas of opportunity at Monarch. Please hear what we're all saying! So many of the same things are being said over and over again."
836948,To be honest I felt a racist vibe when I came in for my chemical peel. The older lady that attended me was caucasian  and I myself am a mexican american .For both of my peels she was rude I thought the first time she was having a bad day but the second time I knew she didn't like me and I don't know why I was very kind for both visits. I don't recommend  going to this place if your not caucasian or you will get that racist stare and tone.
843138,"Overall a decent place to eat.  Very dark interior and food was ok. Service started out good but went down hill. Went right past our table to another and asked them how they liked their food. When he came to our table first things out of his mouth was would we need a box.  Not saying it is a racist place but it sure seemed like it.  Can't blame the restaurant but some people just don't need to be in customer service.

Prices weren't bad for what you get. I probably won't return due to the customer service but if you want bbq to knock off your bucket list this place would do."
858398,"I've never felt more disrespected in my life. The security guard outside of the restaurant was rude, inappropriate and incredibly racist and I will never return to this restaurant again. I hope you don't support this behavior either."
864516,"Rude, racist servers and the food is really really late. Don't give them your business."
872842,"I've gone here a few times and started going because I knew someone in one of my classes recommended it to me. Food was good, although they put way too much oil and vinegar on your sandwich. Even if you only ask for a little! The last couple experiences have been ruined by the staff. The (I'm guessing high school age) boys that work there are extremely rude. I asked for a sandwich that a former employee used to make for me but I forgot his name for a second. I guessed and said his name might have been Jose (it was Angelo, way off). However, instead of politely correcting me the kid replied "" Are you talking about Angelo? You were way off! JOSE!?"" Then proceeded to laugh and call me racist.... It was a simple mistake and I did not appreciate being laughed at and called racist especially in an establishment where the workers should be polite and know better... The food is good, too bad I won't be back after that experience."
880065,"First let me comment on the staff. They are polite, respectful, and actually helpful; no crotchety old racist guys who don't seem to want to help.

Prices are very competitive - they were actually the lowest of the 3 LGS (and of course 2 big chain stores). Good recommendations on ammo (small assortment, but in stock)."
884073,"I'll put it this way - I was in a party with 8 white friends and two brown folks (one of which was me) - guess which two of us were told to wait in line, while the rest of our party was let in.

We were kept waiting outside in line while our friends were inside (they eventually left in disgust) - we were with mostly black and brown folks out in line for about half an hour before we finally left. Multiple people, men and women, who were white were let in, while all the non whites were left to wait outside. 

Basically - obviously racist staff, not worth it - don't go here. These folks belong in a different century, not for the speakeasy ambiance but rather for the racism."
884102,"Arrived on Sunday, September 22, 2014 just at the end of the 2nd quarter Panthers/Steelers game.  We sat in the sports bar area and the waitress came over and asked were we sat in the area. I replied no. She said usually on game nights they sit guest but she would take care of us.  We ordered a water and ice tea and reviewed the menu while she went for our drinks.  When she returned it was asked if we needed more time to review the menu. That's where we went wrong!  We said yes and it was going into half time of the game.  We waited, waited, waited, waited...a few waitress went by and we still waited, waited, waited!!! The game was in mid 3rd quarter when we decided to leave!  I ask to speak to a manager on the way out because this wax my 3rd time in this establishment in a year and each time there was horrible service.  

My opinion is not to ever go to thus place. The first time I went it felt a little racist and no service to my table. The 2nd time was the same.  My last time was just a service issue an completely unacceptable.   

Terrible service and customer service compared to other Buffalo Wild Wing locations I have been to!!!!"
888578,"I don't even know where to start ... but I know I will never return.

We were a group of 6 that entered BZ's at 11pm on NYE.  It was pretty empty and we easily found a nice space to enjoy the countdown.  Our server was great but thats is where it ends.  

Now I do not drink and haven't in 5 years so I was DD.  My friends enjoy quality cocktails and are will to spend good money.  First drink on the Menu that was orderby my friend KK is amazing no longer on the menu,  second drink they are out of basil, next drink something else was missing, and she settles for basically whiskey and soda.  STRIKE ONE.

So we wanted some food ... and being NYE we didn't expect a full menu.  They had a decent buffet for $30 but it was only going to be up for another 15 mins and then it was going to switch over to a breakfast buffet at 12 for $10.  $30 is steep for 15mins and who knows how long the food was out.  We figured we would wait until the breakfast buffet but did offer that we would pay $20 for both.  They said no so we decided to wait until after midnight.  Now one of our group had a reaction to some medication he was taking and medication.  We shut him off and wanted to get him some food.  So are server did not bring him any other drinks but that did not stop the bartender from giving him two more beers.  STRIKE TWO.

So now we are uncomfortable and still trying to enjoy NYE.  So I leave with my friend to get him some food but none was to be found because most places were shut down around BZ's.  Not their fault.  It was cold so we returned to BZ's and my friend went downstairs to the restroom.  After a few minutes he did not return so I went to look for him.  As I pass a table to go down stairs a notice a female (possibly employee) with a child (about 8).  Now I am not an attorney but I know it is illegal for children to be at a bar.  STRIKE THREE.

I went down stairs and could not find my friend.  I thought I might have missed him and he would be somewhere else upstairs.  Possibly getting served at the bar again.  At this time another friend joined us and I returned to our table for the count down still without our one friend.  We did the countdown and I returned downstairs to look for my friend again.  I found him lost in a separate hallway and took him back upstairs.  I suggest we pay up and leave.  We paid our bill and left a nice tip.  As we were exiting we ran into the most racist cook on earth who was running around yelling ""These white people are crazy and other comments I CANNOT REPEAT.""  We exited the building and the cook came outside still yelling.  He followed us down the street to our cars and we felt threatened.  Now if I made anyone of the comments he made towards us replacing White with Black i would probably be in jail.  He should be fired immediately.  STRIKE FOUR.

Happy New Years BZ's and congratulations on having the worst place I ever visited in my life.  Too bad I can't figure out to give you zero stars."
893671,"i don't know  what's  up with this place, oh wait yes i do poor management!  manager jj or bj is a real racist asshole who seems to be over compensating  for something  hmmmm..... waitress was very unattentive and seemed  to be playing  musical waiters as so many different  employees  came to my table to refill and drop off food. with this many employees  in a half dead restaurant  why was my waitress m. i. a. ?  even with all the extra help refills took forever. staff is too busy socializing to do thier job. plus roaches and flys in the salad bar and even mice cutting you off at the ankles. never again!!!  i'm pretty critcal of most places but i'd sooner get a hot dog from the circle k in front before i ever eat here. don't waste your money or your time!"
899895,I don't recommend anyone coming here. I like William Hill Sports Book even that I don't recommend this gaming location. Extremely racist management and yes they do discriminatory practices. Racial discrimination that Nevada Gaming Board allows of those with gaming licenses. My Casino discriminates against Blacks with backpacks and do not allow them to enter the casino. When reading the sign that says backpacks not allowed. Is like saying Blacks are not allowed. When confronted with Casino Manager who solemnly made discriminating decision Mark Zakini he seemed to take the issue likely and jokingly assumed there will be no consequences.
904296,"Most corrupted ""security"" system ever. A best friend of mine worked at this place in Omaha, Ne. Their director of operations, Josh Norman and his buddies, were as irresponsible as could be. I saw some reviews on how this security is never there on time or how they're useless. Yeah I wonder why, when their director use to be MOD hardly did he ever do his own job, instead he is packing his very few employees (to not have to pay for having many employees) with cites, and obviously these employees do their best but it is humanly impossible to be able to cover these many cites along with constant alarm calls within their 8 hour shifts. Pack them up with 10 hour shifts? yeah!... because these employees are ""robots"" right?! Not only are the ""directors of operations"" lazy, they are immature people making racist comments to some of their employees. Of course nobody has the courage to complain, a job is a job correct? True, but why does this useless security even exist then? Not only is it a terrible place to work at, it is a useless ""Security Protection"". This is just the gist of it all."
904997,"This place was absolutely fantastic! After reading both good & bad reviews about this place on yelp me & my husband decided to take a chance with this steakhouse. I was a little worried me being a african American girl I read a review that said this place was racist against black ppl. Absolutely Not! I got a different vibe from them. My husband is italian & although I did feel like the host at the front door who greeted us upon arrival & sat us down @ our seats was a little weird.  When she told us to enjoy our dinner she only told it to him not me, I mean literally looking him in his face, I almost felt imaginary lol. Idk maybe I was being too sensitive. Then when she sat us down she asked us if we wanted the small table sat for 2 or a bigger table set for 4. We choose the bigger table because the table for two was more for a table of 1 once you have food on it. We had to wait for the table to be cleaned off and set. We saw napkins forks & knives set on the table so my husband asked the lady if we could have a seat now, she then sarcastically said ""glasses"" as if he was dumb for not knowing that. After the table was set we had a seat & the lady apologized for the table not being ready upon our arrival. Our server was very nice & polite always checking up on us. I can't stand when your @ a resturant  & you have to look all over  for your sever. That was definitely not the case here. The food was excellent I got the brick chicken & my husband got the bone in rib eye steak. I'm usually not a steak person, like I don't even like Fogo De Chao. But the steak here @ this place was phenomenal!  I had the brick chicken & it was delicious so much flavor! Will definitely be back to visit this place next time I'm in Vegas! Go! You will not be disappointed"
905297,"I came here after my graduation ceremony to celebrate with my family.  The service was horrible, for lack of a better word. We didn't leave a tip due to the service. The owner came and asked me why there was no tip and I thought it would be for constructive criticism but he started arguing with me instead. In addition, he made a racist comment. Very unprofessional. He was in denial that they offered terrible service and refused to listen to what I had to say to improve their service. I have never experience such treatment or service and I eat out daily. To top it off, the food was salty. 

There is a Chinese restaurant next to this one, Szechwan Palace, that offers better service and food...go there instead."
907059,The food service & quality are awful. The manager is racist & said he doesn't serve my kind! The kitchen staff said he doesn't serve my kind & told me I ordered something different from what I ordered. I've been there twice & he completely messed up an Italian beef sandwich & the worst thin crust pizza I ever had. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Windy City beefs & pizza or Brandos are real Chicago bars with good Chicago pizza! He called me a liar about a wet Italian beef sandwich & then served me a dry beef with cheese! He said I ordered it that way & then came back to apologize he was wrong. As for the thin crust I ordered I never got thin crust pizza and that's what I ordered & he argued & called me names even in front of the bartender & customers. He called me a liar & told me to never come back. Health inspectors were also there! AWFUL FOOD & AWFUL SERVICE!!!!
908229,"So I drove past this place for a long time and asked my fiends if they have ever gone to tho store. One of my friends has and told me that they were racist and had bad customer service. I didn't believe him and I was curious so I went to the store. 

Wow when I first entered it was big with just about everything in there, it was almost like a mini bass pro shop but for farming and country people. I walked up and down each aisle, and picked up some random things that I thought were cool. Then I strolled to the firearms section to the far right of the entrance.

The associate was helping a customer so I waited about 5 feet from the counter and stood there quietly so they could ask if I needed anything. I waited as he finished answering the customers questions. I stood there after the customer left. I stood there quietly as the associate behind the desk glanced at me and went behind his cash register, and after another minute of silence I got tired of feeling ignored and felt like, Wow really!? How can they ignore a customer like that??  So I got mad and walked off to see if I could find some rope. (I know i'm random.)

As I walked away this other associate just walking by asked me if I needed any help and I asked her about the firearms and ammo. She went to the firearms section and I followed. They seemed to ignore her for a little bit and then they answered her questions. I wanted to buy some ammo but on of the guys behind the desk said you must be over 21 to buy ammo claiming it was, ""some company policy."" that comment was straight BS and I made my opinion clear that it wasn't true. The other guy radioed if they could sell me ammo. The answer was as long as they are older than 18. I bought my ammo, got my rope, and left. I was disappointed in how rude they can be by ignoring and falsifying information to discourage me from buying what i wanted.. It's like saying we don't want your business.  I'm not saying you guys are racist but you need to treat your customers better."
922370,"This nail salon deserves 0 stars . I was thoroughly disappointed and offended when I left. My nails are shaped funny and the expensive gel polish that I pay for did not cover my nails . Additionally one of my nails fell off the next day at work while I was using my keyboard... not an activity that is hard on nails.
The nail tech lifted up her foot, put it on her chair in front of me and used the nail file she just used on my hands to file her toes. She did this while my nails were drying and I was completely disgusted and wondered how clean this place could be. 

Racism.... worse anything that was done to my nails at budha bar was that my nail tech made a derogatory comment about African Americans. I was horrified. Apparently she could not tell that I am mixed and also, something she could have considered, I have a wonderful mixed family that are my life and the love of my life is black. Regardless however not being able to know how another person feels, those who deal with the public should never express their racist feelings while at work. I am also disappointed that she cannot be more sensitive as her race is one that has been subject too terrible generalizations since 911.

The salon owner did not know anything that went on because he was asleep in a pedicure chair during the entire time. Not very professional. I will never foot in the Buddha Bar again."
923729,"This club is discriminatory in it's entrance procedures.  This place needs to be exposed for it's racist policies.  Totally ridiculous behavior for a club that is trying to be a top-of-the-line establishment in Charlotte. Heard it's not doing well, hope a new place moves in soon."
923736,"What a trash establishment! For the first time in Charlotte, NC and one of the few times in my life, I experienced BLATANT racism. Went out to celebrate a friend's birthday and made this stop as we bar hopped through the city. There was a short line, and after 15 minutes, it was announced you could only get in if you were on the list OR bought a table. I think we caught the staff of guard when we casually agreed to buy a table. This man looked confused, consults with another bouncer, and then says ""There are no more tables."" Ummm what????!?? It was at that time, as we watched several white patrons enter without issue that we realized they simply wanted no more coloreds in there. We left and I vowed to never visit this establishment again, which I haven't and won't. If you go to Oak Room, you're supporting a racist establishment. Period.

I've heard through the grapevine that on Wednesday nights and Wednesday nights ONLY, they allow minorities in. I'm not going to be the one to find out whether it's true or not."
932077,"Who would have thought a three star review and the word ""grumpy"" could result in a police report for battery? 

I won't be coming here again after my recent experience. My BF wrote a review that pointed out the male owner was grumpy, due to his frequent unprofessional demeanor and tone.

A few evenings ago, we were grabbing a coffee in the drive-thru and the man began calling him racist epithets peppered with F-bombs. This escalated to spitting in his face and chasing our car with a baseball bat while screaming threats. All because he was called grumpy, which was clearly the understatement of the century.

How ironic to think this all started over lackluster customer service. No wonder this place is always empty despite being across the street from a college campus."
945715,"This place has horrible customer service. After dealing with the rude cashier I cancelled my order and left out of principal. 
Furthermore, this company is racist and It's probably better not to support them."
954494,"We are in town for the Fraternal Order of Police Convention. We are seated near the Brick Oven and order about 40 dollars worth of food and drink to start including a pizza. There's a black guy there making pizzas and very loudly says ""you've been slinging pizza all day for cops"" speaking to his co workers, They can kiss my ass, twice! We are both police officers and brought this to the attention of our waiter who felt really bad and got the chef and the manager . They apologized and offered to move us. But really? Do I want this racist asshole making my food ? Unless he was fired on the spot, nothing's gonna make me stay there. Officers been eating there all day, giving there money to a place that would employ a guy like that ."

Thank you for your response. I admire your actions to correct the situation . I am the President of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 85.  Police officers put our lives on the line every day to protect the lives of people we don't even know.  It is very disheartening when people take that for granted and feel that it is ok to make disparaging remarks to those of us who chose this noble profession . More often than not, remarks such as those that were made last night come from
Those who have chosen quite a different path in life, one that lands them on the wrong side of the law and rather then take responsibility for their actions they choose to blame the ones who caught them . Thank you for being a stand up organization . 

Sincerely ,

Nicole"
984039,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made an appointment for a consultation a week ago on hair extensions. I specifically asked that it be with someone who knew how to do ethnic hair as I am mixed. I get there and the girl looking at my hair basically had no clue what to recommend for me and referred me to another stylist that wasn't in. So I go to the front desk to rebook a new consultation with the correct person only to call and confirm my appointment and discover it wasn't even booked. To have the nerve to ask me to come back AGAIN after you screwed me over the first two times and wasted my time isn't acceptable. Learn how to listen to your clients needs and requests and book appropriately and accurately. I wonder if they're just typical racist assholes who don't cater to mixed clientele or anything other than your average Scottsdale industry girl which would explain my poor experiences with them. So glad I didn't let anyone in this place touch my hair considering they can't even figure out their appointment book. I would stay far far away from this wannabe high end salon.
984253,Mellow mushroom is terrible.  I have never written a review before but this place is a grotesquely racist establishment and i never want to return to it ever again.  I would give it negative 100 stars if i could.
987267,"I won't say for sure that this place is a racist establishment, but it sure seemed that way. I wish I could give it negative stars. My dad and brother were in town so we went here to grab some burgers and beers. The beer buckets came out relatively quick, but we waited for our food for OVER AN HOUR before deciding to leave for another burger joint. Yes, that's right, OVER AN HOUR and the food STILL hadn't come out. We ordered 4 burgers and I was starting to wonder if they had to go out and slaughter the cows or something, it was taking that long. The table to our right which showed up at least an hour after we ordered and the table behind us which showed up at least 30 minutes after we ordered both had their food brought out before ours and the only difference between those tables and us? Well, our party had 3 black people whereas the other tables were all white people. 

Like I said, I won't say for sure whether we were treated crappily because of race, but really, there should be no reason whatsoever for me to even get that impression. The waitress was ok (I think her name was Brooklyn), but she should have noticed that we had been waiting for our food for, again, OVER AN HOUR and she should have done something about it. I used to wait tables back in my college days and I never would have let customers just sit for over an hour. The manager (who I'm pretty sure was drunk) should have done more than just give us 50% off of the two beer buckets we ordered. They should have been 100% off considering the HORRIBLE service and experience we had.

My alma mater sometimes has alumni events here, but I will be contacting the president of the alumni association to ensure that future watch parties and alumni events are NEVER held at this place. I have never had such a horrible experience or been treated so terribly in my life. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."
994555,If I can give you 0 stars I would. I used to love / I just look forward to the driver said I would get to be with that or I mean and the stories that I could tell the next day. Now I just noticed that you guys are all just money grabbers everyone don't care they don't follow the five minute I have to stay there rule because you might be paying your bill where you might be saying bye to friends. Hoover besides this racist CEO could be the worst service I've ever used in my entire life. I requested 3 / drivers at the same location that I usually get picked up at in Old Town Scottsdale. Because all of them thought that they had something better to do i download left innocence 3 minutes is there and then we took me home and made sure that I was ok going home. Hoover you're pathetic I'm deleting your app honestly think that you should screen all of your drivers because they all suck and that's just me being honest best of luck in the future I will bring your IPO comes out is fails and that's that
994670,"I have been putting this review off for a while because I was uncertain how to put pen to paper, but I can't procrastinate any longer.  I am going to treat this review much like a work related evaluation and utilize the ""compliment sandwich"".  So here it goes.

A great shout out to Rachel C, our CM for organizing the event and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for supplying our tickets to the show.  It was great finally being able to meet Rachel and the generosity of the PCT was phenomenal.  I will never turn down an opportunity to view any event at the beautiful historic Benedum Center.  Again many thanks!

Now as far as the ""musical"" goes I will point out as others have, this was originally written as an opera.  I am not a fan of operatic singing and though I liked several of the songs the switching back and forth from operatic signing to more main stream musical was not pleasing to my ears.  I barely could understand the words when they were belted out in this format.  The storyline was ok, however it had several racist undertones depicting African American's during this time period as fighting, gambling, drinking, drug abusing criminals.  The story was also at times hard to follow, possibly because of the manner of the singing which left me disinterested at some times.  I have seen several musicals at the Benedum and this was the most disappointing.  

Furthermore, for the last piece of bread on my sandwich, I really think the actors did a great job.  I may not be a huge fan of this work, but I think the cast was top notch, and acting and dancing were entertaining.  And as always any event at the Benedum is worth going to as 9 times out of 10 the experience is splendid."
996786,"I just hate the fact that this people are so quick to charge money for their job but the problem here is that they do a horrible job.  I rather do my own nails from now on . I always have horrible experiences with nail places  I decided to give it a try to this place and was the worst mistake.  They were so quick to sit me down and tell me prices  . My nails seemed  like they put to much nail polish  , my nails looked un even  and when it was time to dry them they just let me there with out checking on me .  Next day the Polish just came right off.  I'm not racist but no more Asian nail places for me."
999462,"So we were at a convention this past weekend and we wanted to get lunch. We've heard a lot about Pizza Studio and we decided to give it a shot. We took our orders, it was farley simple. We gave them our names when we went to made the orders. We were sitting at our table, we noticed my friend's pizza coming out, the runner yelled out Kristina,  his recipe said Kristian. The runner then gives my pizza to some random guy who said it was his. The random guy wrapped it up in the paper and ran out the door. Not to be racist or anything, but the runner was Mexican and so was the guy who took my friends pizza, the food runner had a pretty thick accent, I'm thinking he may have been in one it, just saying. Anyways, my food came out and it was pretty good. When my friend went up to confront them, they said we're going to make you another one, it's like they knew they gave it away and instead of informing him, it looks like they were going to make him one and not tell him they ""accidentally "" gave it away to the wrong guy, they weren't even apologetic. The food was great, but it seemed like they didn't really care that they gave my friends pizza away and it seemed like they wanted to cover it up by making him one and hoping he didn't notice."
1002103,"I  love this place- really good- fresh, semi-authentic Mexican faster food. Excellent Taco Shop!

Another reviewer mentioned the decor being tacky (what do people from Ohio know?... j/k). I completely DISAGREE- it's Mexican wrestler themed- fun, hip and trendy- The theme reminds me of El Carmen in LA. If only they served margaritas and beer they would be packed!

The people that work here (maybe the owners?) are very nice- they will let you taste all the different stewed meats. It's been a long time since I've gone to a Mexican establishment in Phoenix that actually serves spicy food. Yum! They do have a Chipotle assembly line style going on, but the food tastes much better. In fact, comparing them to Chipotle never even occurred to me the couple times I have been here until I read that in people's reviews- and I do eat at Chipotle on occasion- but I really don't think this place is anything like Chipotle at all. It's like a Taco Shop- most Taco Shops are set up in a similar style- perhaps you get more ""choices"" here in regard to ""toppings""... I dunno. People are far too critical. Maybe it's because Phoenix is so white bred that the only Taco Shop experience people have is Chipotle, so, they assume that Taco Shops are copying Chipotle... what came first Taco Shop or Chipotle? Chicken or Egg? Plant or seed? Life's questions....

From one gringo to another, this is not an unusual set up for a Taco Shop- it's just a far nicer/trendier interior than an average taco shop- with very good service. Really, it's okay that they let you choose what kind of meat you want on your taco or burrito etc. and make it in front of you. It's probably a lot easier for them to do it this way since I have noticed that the guy working doesn't seem to speak the best English. Either that or he's really on ""drugs"" like some whitey wrote in a review... I think it's more of language thing than a drug thing... So, I will pretend I didn't read that other racist review that I read and found incredibly offensive- speckled with accusatory undertones because they were charged for guac. Give it a rest Güero!

I don't see anything wrong with the set up, wanted to reiterate that in case my point didn't come across earlier. It's a TACO SHOP...   Even taco trucks let you decide what kind of meat you want and what ""toppings""... ""Toppings"" as if it's a pizza... lol! 

Yelp irritates me sometimes... If they had a bowl full of spicy carrots and jalapenos you foodie snobs would be calling it pedestrian.  However, I think it would be nice if they served up some dishes with cotijah cheese, but I digress- Cheese may not have been a traditional element in Mexican cooking as many reviews here mention, but now days it's a staple. Take it or leave it folks, like it or not- Mexican places in Phoenix serve cheese on things. If the cheese makes the food generic- don't get cheese on it. Simple as that. I like cilantro and onions on my stuff personally. You know, most ethnic restaurants offer options to satisfy American palates- there is nothing wrong with the option for cheese. Someone wrote in a review- complaining that this place doesn't serve lingua... Serious? Big Whoop. There are Korean places in town that don't serve DOG- are you all gonna get on your Yelp Machines and start comparing it to... PF Changs or something, lol! Yes, I realize PF Changs isn't Korean, but it's not really Asian food eiether... Look, I'm being a Yelp foodie snob... Pot meet kettle!

I guess what might confuse some is it is almost restauranty, but still casual fast foody. I don't mind that- then again, I'm not one for manicured lawns and beige HOA tract homes. It's human nature to want to compartmentalize, label, file away... I have an over abundance of higher priority life mysteries to dwell on- I like the damn food- and the green chilies are smokin' hot! Nothing tastes bland. I also appreciate the option for cabbage rather than lettuce and I like their salsa choices- I don't mind not having an assortment of 20 different things (this is in response to other critiques). It's a TACO SHOP- I don't expect them to have 20 different salsas- but I do expect the salsas they have to taste fresh and good, and they do! They are also spicy- which gets me HOT! 

Coming from LA, this place reminds me of some of the hip taco shops we had over there, just  tastier than many and much nicer/fun decor- really cute. 

You have to try this place out- just don't go in there all hoity-toity expecting a white cloth dining establishment. Appreciate it for what it is- a good TACO SHOP."
1017986,"Well I don't post as much as I should because most service is mediocre to begin with. There are times when everyone and their kids needs to know what's up. This place is horrific, everything is bad. Inside decor: that exist? Really you painted the tiles! Outside decor: again what's that? At this point I am still okay, just fix my problem. The only guy working there, checks out my car. Tells me there is a amplifier issue. (To be fair I will adjust by one star if he turns out to be right). Now we get to the fun stuff...He tells me that there is a 1 truck in front of me. It will be about an hour or so. Cool, I already pissed the day away trying to get this fixed. What's an hour or so? I waited, hour and 20 minutes, another couple show up talking in Spanish. I am not racist nor stupid. When he comes back in he tells me he can't look at or fix my car. There are now 2 more trucks in front of me. That he has a business to run. WTF? I called him out on it. Also let him know I talked to the dealer and asked them about it. They confirmed there is no Amp in that car. I went a step further and chat with Buick corporate office this evening shown below. After I tell him that, he barks back while getting into the new couples car that if I know so much to fix it myself.  At this point, I am trying not to get mad. Just leave!!! So I went to Performance Audio on Sahara (Top 12 in the Nation, they told me they can fix it, appointment set).

Jonathan Lanier [6:57 PMxxxxxxxxx 38000 miles
Jonathan Lanier [6:58 PM]: I dont know the vin,
Alexander [6:58 PM]: That is alright, how might I be able to help you today?
Jonathan Lanier [6:59 PM]: I can't seem to get help anywhere, even the audio shops here, dealership...etc point to each other. I have a 2009 buick lucerne cx, is there an Amplifier in it? If so where? It does NOT have a Bose system, it IS standard. The front right speaker makes noises even when the audio system is off, the sound gets higher as I rev up, start or turn off the car.
Alexander [7:01 PM]: Well I looked through all of the feature on the 2009 Lucerne and I do see that the vehicle does not have a amplifier. Now did the dealership diagnose and try and fix this issue before?
Jonathan Lanier [7:02 PM]: No, I took it there, they didn't even attempt it.
Alexander [7:03 PM]: What did they say?
Jonathan Lanier [7:03 PM]: They just said to take it to a audio store.
Jonathan Lanier [7:04 PM]: So it has to be a grounding issue?
Jonathan Lanier [7:05 PM]: or could it be the unit itself?
Alexander [7:05 PM]: Unfortunately Jonathan this I am not technical trained and I would not be able to provide any kind of actual suggestions on what the issue could be.
Jonathan Lanier [7:06 PM]: OKay, thanks"
1026458,"WOW. Thank you for opening a legit boba place in Arizona. I'm from socal, and boba is like our Napa Valley wine. The honey boba were perfectly chewy and slightly sweet. The location is really nice, very white people (WP) friendly (not racist at all), unexpected since most boba places I go to are in asian saturated ghettos. Nice decor. The girls that work their are attractive, which makes ordering a large a lot more convenient (yes it does not make sense). I usually get royal milk tea, and I can compare it to socal half&half. Great ambience. Wish they had larger tables so I can study there. And if someone can regularly refill the hand soap and paper towels in the bathroom that would be nice. I end up blowing on my hands to dry them off, then applying some hand sanitizer that I carry everywhere, and using my foot to open the door."
1027021,"I'm sorry thirdspace I'd love to give you higher scores because your food is not bad at all but just not worth the disrespect I received during my visit. I came here a couple weeks ago and that was a pleasant experience with attentive service, good sandwich and great nitro cold brew coffee from next door. So today I came back to have some food before checking out the grand avenue festival. I came in and seated myself and I can see it's definitely more crowded than last time. So I waited patiently to get a menu. 10 minutes later, after a number of eye contact with 4 different staffs I'm still sitting here with no menu or even any greetings acknowledging I'm here! Three different staffs came to take the order, bring out food, check if everything is ok with the table in front of me and to my right, yet no one cares to stop by to say anything to me! 15minutes later I walked to the bar asked for a menu and put in my order! All by myself! Still I gave them reasonable amount of tip to show them my respect in return to all the disrespect from them. Then I got my food, ate my food and finished it. Cannot complain about the quality of the food but once again no one has come to check on me even though they keeping walking past me 10plus times to check on tables next to mine! Until my departure no one has said anything!!! Thanks to thirdspace I received the 'warmest' service I've ever had anywhere in the whole world. Even a Viennese restaurant is not on the same level as you guys lol. I don't know you are racist or what, it has been such a disgusting experience and no thanks I won't bring myself to go through all this again!"
1029607,"Janice, the ""Greeter"" that has worked every one of the four times I have been in this store, is the absolute worst!! She has specifically targeted one of my roommates when we leave simply based upon the color of his skin! My female roommate and I have mobility issues and she has been snippy and crass when we have asked about the availability of electric carts. Janice is racist and rude and is the main reason we refuse to shop at this location. We went in there this evening and left individually to ""test"" what we already knew; Janice watched my male roommate at the register and RAN to stop him AFTER telling both my female roommate and I to have a good night!!

Upon returning home, I called the store and the phone rang for FIVE MINUTES before I got the automated, ""Your call is important to us. Please be patient and your call will be routed to the next available associate."" After a total of 18:30 minutes, the system hung up on me!!"
1048442,This was the worst place I have ever been. The bartender was racist and sexually aggressive towards my wife. I have never been so publicly humiliated. If you have any respect for humankind you will never go here. I have never posted anything online before and created a yelp account solely for the purpose of alerting people to this abomination of a business.
1059385,"Stopped by the place on what seemed to be a quiet night, service was great, staff was friendly and sociable. Had a couple of drinks with my wife. She enjoyed the atmosphere and we sat outside on their deck.   I read some of the post about this place and the claim that they are racist towards Hispanics. Being Puerto Rican I was prepared to meet resistance but was greeted by the friendly staff. We like the look and enjoy the .atmosphere Would recommend Milk Bar to anyone, cant say anything about the food because we didn't have any. But ,I'll write another review and let you know after our next visit."
1059400,"I just got back from here and the experience was just amazing. You don't come here for just the food or for drinks. You come here for both. Think of it as you favorite wine bar, except you switch the wine out for vodka and the Italian food for Polish. All the Polish customary staples are on the menu, and executed better than any other Polish store in town. 

I had the pickled herrings which were on point and the pierogies with potato and cheese. They were also really good, make sure you get the toppings. The portion size for the pierogies can be small, but expected as quantities are notated in the menu. To be fair, the food menu is fairly priced. Prices start at about $5 and up. My wife and I were able to get a little bit of everything, we personally liked the menu set up. She got the hunters stew. We drank the Clockwork Orange and Copernicus. Both very good cocktails, a bit of each spectrum.

This is not the typical Polish bar that has the grocery store attachment, which I hate by the way. So to say this place has an identity crisis is an utter statement of confusion and ignorance. It's new and unique to the valley, sure, but the elements and details of the restaurant tie back into modern Polish culture. 

I'm Polish, and this place made me connect with past memories and experiences that I've had in Poland when I visited as a child. It represents my favorite Polish attributes, a pollacks love for vodka, a pollacks high energy which is usually channeled though electronic music, their taste for European interiors which are synonymous with minimalism and modern, and the direct yet friendly service. My wife is Asian, so the racist remarks earlier I also agree are B.S.

Milk Bar will be my favorite novelty secret spot to bring friends."
1075926,I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately we overheard the bartender making several racist remarks about our party. Food was more or less mediocre.Have had better. I will not be returning.
1079575,"We have gotten take out from this location a few times and it's always missing things or put in the wrong boxes with the wrong sides, etc. One time we ordered queso to go and it looked and tasted more like refried beans than queso. It was absolutely disgusting. We recently decided to dine in and watch football on a Sunday though, hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The bartender, Jarrod, was offensive, rude and belligerent the entire time. He made some borderline racist comments, tried WAY too hard to be funny but just came off as an ass instead, cussed repeatedly and put down customers and their sports teams to their faces. Jarrod definitely wasn't the type of employee I imagine Chili's hiring and putting up with and believe they would be just as shocked at his behavior behind the bar as we were. In fact, the overall organization and service at this establishment is an embarrassment to Chili's and should be evaluated. In the mean time, if you're looking for quality food, cooked to your specification, go somewhere else, or drive to the litchfield Park Chili's instead. You'll be glad you did."
